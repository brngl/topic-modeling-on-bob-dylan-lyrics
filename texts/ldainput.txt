ain t it just like the night to play tricks when you re trying to be so quiet we all sit here stranded though we re all doing our best to deny it and louise holds a handful of rain tempting you to defy it lights flicker from the opposite loft in this room the heat pipes just cough the country music station plays soft but there s nothing� really nothing to turn off just louise and her lover so entwined and these visions of johanna that conquer my mind in the empty lot where the ladies play blindman s bluff with the key chain and the all night girls they whisper of escapades out on the d train we can hear the night watchman click his flashlight ask himself if it s him or them that s insane louise she s alright she s just near she s delicate and seems like the mirror but she just makes it all too concise and too clear that johanna s not here the ghost of lectricity howls in the bones of her face where these visions of johanna have now taken my place now little boy lost he takes himself so seriously he brags of his misery he likes to live dangerousl and when bringing her name up he speaks of a farewell kiss to me he s sure got a lot of gall to be so useless and all muttering small talk at the wall while i m in the hall oh how can i explain it s so hard to get on and these visions of johanna they kept me up past the dawn inside the museums infinity goes up on trial voices echo � this is what salvation must be like after a while� but mona lisa musta had the highway blues you can tell by the way she smiles see the primitive wallflower freeze when the jelly faced women all sneeze hear the one with the mustache say � jeez i can t find my knees � oh jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule but these visions of johanna they make it all seem so cruel the peddler now speaks to the countess who s pretending to care for him saying � name me someone that s not a parasite and i ll go out and say a prayer for him � but like louise always says � you can t look at much can you man � as she herself prepares for him and madonna she still has not showed we see this empty cage now corrode where her cape of the stage once had flowed the fiddler he now steps to the road he writes � everything s been returned which was owed� on the back of the fish truck that loads while my conscience explodes the harmonicas play the skeleton keys in the rain and these visions of johanna are now all that remain

far between sundown s finish and midnight s broken toll we ducked inside the doorway as thunder went crashing as majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight and for each and every underdog soldier in the night and we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing through the city s melted furnace unexpectedly we watched with faces hidden as the walls were tightening as the echo of the wedding bells before the blowing rain dissolved into the bells of the lightning tolling for the rebel tolling for the rake tolling for the luckless the abandoned and forsaked tolling for the outcast burning constantly at stake and we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail the sky cracked its poems in naked wonder that the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder striking for the gentle striking for the kind striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind and the poet and the painter far behind his rightful time and we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing in the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales for the disrobed faceless forms of no position tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts all down in taken for granted situations tolling for the deaf and blind tolling for the mute for the mistreated mate less mother the mis titled prostitute for the misdemeanor outlaw chained and cheated by pursuit and we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing even though a cloud s white curtain in a far off corner flared and the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting electric light still struck like arrows fired but for the ones condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting tolling for the searching ones on their speechless seeking trail for the lonesome hearted lovers with too personal a tale and for each unharmful gentle soul misplaced inside a jail and we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing starry eyed and laughing as i recall when we were caught trapped by no track of hours for they hang suspended as we listened one last time and we watched with one last look spellbound and swallowed till the tolling ended tolling for the aching whose wounds cannot be nursed for the countless confused accused misused strung out ones and worse and for every hung up person in the whole wide universe and we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

while riding on a train going west i fell asleep for to take my rest i dreamed a dream that made me sad concerning myself and the first few friends i had with half damp eyes i stared to the room where my friends and i spent many an afternoon where we together weathered many a storm laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn by the old wooden stove where our hats was hung our words was told our songs was sung where we longed for nothing and were satisfied joking and talking about the world outside with hungry hearts through the heat and cold we never much thought we could get very old we thought we could sit forever in fun our chances really was a million to one as easy it was to tell black from white it was all that easy to tell wrong from right and our choices they was few so the thought never hit that the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split how many a year has passed and gone many a gamble has been lost and won and many a road taken by many a first friend � and each one i ve never seen again i wish� i wish� i wish in vain that we could sit simply in that room again ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat i d give it all gladly if our lives could be like that

up on the white veranda she wears a necktie and a panama hat her passport shows a face from another time and place she looks a nothing like that and all of the remnants of her recent past are scattered in the wild wind she walks across the marble floor where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in she smiles walks the other way as the last ship sails and the moon fades away from black diamond bay as the morning light breaks open the greek comes down and he asks for rope and a pen that will write � pardon monsieur � the desk clerk says carefully removes his fez � am i hearing you right � and as the yellow fog is lifting the greek is quickly heading for the second floor she passes him on the spiral staircase thinking he s the soviet ambassador she starts to speak but he walks away as the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway on black diamond bay a soldier sits beneath the fan doing business a with a tiny man who sells him a ring lightning strikes the lights blow out the desk clerk wakes he begins to shout � can you see anything � then the greek appears on the second floor in his bare feet with a rope around his neck while a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle says � open up another deck� but the dealer says � attendez vous s il vous pla� t� as the rain beats down and the cranes fly away from black diamond bay the desk clerk heard the woman laugh as he looked around in the aftermath and the soldier got tough he tried to grab the woman s hand said � here s a ring it cost a grand � she said � that ain t enough � then she ran upstairs to pack her bags while a horse drawn taxi waited at the curb she passed the door where the greek had locked where a handwritten sign read a � do not disturb� she knocked upon it anyway as the sun went down and the music did play on black diamond bay � i ve got to talk to someone quick � but the greek said � go away � and he kicked the chair to the floor he hung there from the chandelier she cried � help there s danger near please a open up a the door � then the volcano erupted and the lava flowed down from the mountain high above the soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner thinking of forbidden love the desk clerk said � it happens every day� as the stars fell down and the moons fade away on black diamond bay as the island slowly sank the loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room the dealer said � it s too late now you can take your money but i don t know how you ll spend it in the tomb � the tiny man bit the soldier s ear as the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew while she s out on the balcony where a stranger tells her � my darling je vous aime beaucoup � she sheds a tear and then begins to pray as the sun burns on and the smoke drifts away from black diamond bay i was sitting home alone one night in l a watching old cronkite on the seven o clock news it seems there was an earthquake that left nothing but a panama hat and a pair of old greek shoes it didn t seem like much was happening so i turned it off and went to grab another beer seem like every time you turn around there s another hard luck story that you re gonna hear and there s really nothing anyone can say � and i never did plan to go anyway to black diamond bay

a bullet from the back of a bush took medgar evers s blood a finger fired the trigger to his name a handle hid out in the dark a hand set the spark two eyes took the aim behind a man s brain but he can t be blamed he s only a pawn in their game a south politician preaches to the poor white man you got more than the blacks don t complain you re better than them you been born with white skin they explain and the negro s name is used it is plain for the politician s gain as he rises to fame and the poor white remains on the caboose of the train but it ain t him to blame he s only a pawn in their game the deputy sheriffs the soldiers the governors get paid and the marshals and cops get the same but the poor white man s used in the hands of them all like a tool he s taught in his school from the start by the rule that the laws are with him to protect his white skin to keep up his hate so he never thinks straight bout the shape that he s in but it ain t him to blame he s only a pawn in their game from the poverty shacks he looks from the cracks to the tracks and the hoof beats pound in his brain and he s taught how to walk in a pack shoot in the back with his fist in a clinch to hang and to lynch to hide neath a hood to kill with no pain like a dog on a chain he ain t a got no name but it ain t him to blame he s only a pawn in their game today medgar evers was buried from the bullet he caught they lowered him down as a king but when the shadowy sun sets on the one that fired the gun he ll see by his grave on the stone that remains carved next to his name his epitaph plain � only a pawn in their game � 
pistol shots ring out in the barroom night enter patty valentine from the upper hall she sees a bartender in a pool of blood cries out � my god they ve killed em all � here comes the story of the � hurricane� the man the authorities came to blame for something that he never done put in a prison cell but one time he could ve been the champion of the world three bodies lying there does patty see and another man named bello moving around mysteriously � i didn t do it � he says and he throws up his hands � i was only robbing the register i hope you understand i saw them leaving � he says and he stops � one of us had better call up the cops � and so patty calls the cops and they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing in the hot new jersey night meanwhile far away in another part of town rubin carter and a couple of friends are driving around the number one contender for the middleweight crown had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down when a cop pulled him over to the side of the road � just like the time before and the time before that in paterson that s just the way things go if you re black you might as well not show up on the street less you wanna draw the heat alfred bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops him and arthur dexter bradley were just out prowling around he said � i saw two men running out they looked like middleweights jumped into a white car with out of state plates � and miss patty valentine just nodded her head cop said � wait a minute boys this one s not dead � so they took him to the infirmary and though this man could hardly see they told him he could identify the guilty men four in the morning and they haul rubin in they took him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs the wounded man looks up through his one dying eye said � why d you bring him in here for he ain t the guy � here s the story of the � hurricane� the man the authorities came to blame for something that he never done put in a prison cell but one time he could ve been the champion of the world four months later the ghettoes are in flame rubin s in south america fighting for his name while arthur dexter bradley s still in the robbery game and the cops are putting the screws to him looking for somebody to blame � remember that murder that you� � happened in a bar remember you said you saw the getaway car think you d like to play ball with the law think it mighta been that fighter that you saw running that night don t forget that you are white � arthur dexter bradley said � i m really not sure � the cops said � a poor boy like you could use a break � we got you for the motel job and you talking to your friend bello if you don t wanna have to go back to jail be a nice fellow you ll be doing society a favor that son of a bitch is brave and getting braver we wanna put his ass in the stir we wanna pin this triple murder on him � he ain t no gentleman jim � rubin could take a man out with just one punch but he never did like to talk about it all that much � it s my work � he d say � and i do it for pay and when it s over just as soon go on my way� � � up into some paradise where the trout streams flow and the air is nice and ride a horse along the trail but then they took him to the jailhouse where they try to turn a man into a mouse all of rubin s cards were marked in advance the trial was a pig circus he never had a chance the judge made rubin s witnesses drunkards from the slums to the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum and to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger no one doubted that he pulled the trigger and though they could not produce the gun the d a said he was the one who did the deed and the all white jury agreed rubin carter was falsely tried the crime was murder one guess who testified � � bello and bradley and they both baldly lied the newspapers they all went along for the ride how can the life of such a man be in the palm of some fool s hand to see him obviously framed couldn t help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land where justice is a game now all the criminals in their coats and their ties are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise while rubin sits like buddha in a ten foot cell an innocent man in a living hell yes that s the story of the � hurricane� but it won t be over till they clear his name and give him back the time he s done put in a prison cell but one time he could ve been the champion of the world

i married isis on the fifth day of may but i could not hold on to her very long so i cut off a my hair and i rode straight away for the wild unknown country where i could not go wrong i came to a high place of darkness and light dividing line ran through the center of town i hitched up my pony to a post on the right went in to the laundry to wash my clothes down a man in the corner approached me for a match i knew right away he was not ordinary he said � are you looking for something easy to catch � said � i got no money � he said � that ain t necessary � we set out that night for the cold in the north i gave him my blanket and he gave me his word i said � where are we going � he said we d be back by the fourth i said � that s the best news that i ve ever heard � i was thinking about turquoise i was thinking about gold i was thinking about diamonds and the world s biggest necklace as we rode through the canyons through the devilish cold i was thinking about isis how she thought i was so reckless how she told me that one day we would meet up again and things would be different the next time we wed if i only could a hang on and just be her friend � i still can t remember all the best things she said we came to the pyramids all embedded in ice he said � there s a body i m trying to find if i carry it out it ll bring a good price � twas a then that i knew what he had on his mind the wind it was howling and the snow was outrageous we chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn when he died i was hoping that it wasn t contagious but i made up my mind that i had to go on i broke into the tomb but the casket was empty there was no jewels no nothing i felt i ve been had when i saw that my partner was just being friendly when i took up his offer i must ve been mad i picked up his body and i dragged him inside threw him down in the hole and i put back the cover i said a quick prayer and i felt satisfied then i rode back to find isis just to tell her i love her she was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise blinded by sleep and in need of a bed i came in from the east with the sun in my eyes i cursed her one time then i rode on ahead she said � where you been � i said � no place special � she said � you look a different � i said � well i guess � she said � you been gone � i said � that s only natural � she said � you gonna stay � i said � if you want me to yes � isis oh isis you re a mystical child what drives a me to you is what drives me insane i still can remember the way that you smiled on the fifth day of may in the drizzling a rain

of war and peace the truth just twists its curfew gull it glides upon four legged forest clouds the cowboy angel rides with his candle lit into the sun though its glow is waxed in black � all except when neath the trees of eden the lamp post stands with folded arms its iron claws attached to curbs neath holes where babies wail though its shadow s metal badge all and all can only fall with a crashing but meaningless blow no sound ever comes from the gates of eden the savage soldier sticks his head in sand and then complains unto the shoe less hunter who s gone deaf but still remains upon the beach where hound dogs bay at ships with tattooed sails heading for the gates of eden with a time rusted compass blade aladdin and his lamp sits with utopian hermit monks sidesaddle on the golden calf and on their promises of paradise you will not hear a laugh � all except inside the gates of eden relationships of ownership they whisper in the wings to those condemned to act accordingly and wait for succeeding kings and i try to harmonize with songs the lonesome sparrow sings there are no kings inside the gates of eden the motorcycle black madonna two wheeled gypsy queen and her silver studded phantom cause the gray flannel dwarf to scream as he weeps to wicked birds of prey who pick up on his breadcrumb sins and there are no sins inside the gates of eden the kingdoms of experience in the precious winds they rot while paupers change possessions each one wishing for what the other has got and the princess and the prince discuss what s real and what is not it doesn t matter inside the gates of eden the foreign sun it squints upon a bed that is never mine as friends and other strangers from their fates try to resign leaving men wholly totally free to do anything they wish to do but die and there are no trials inside the gates of eden at dawn my lover comes to me and tells me of her dreams with no attempts to shovel the glimpse into the ditch of what each one means at times i think there are no words but these to tell what s true and there are no truths outside the gates of eden

well frankie lee and judas priest they were the best of friends so when frankie lee needed money one day judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens and placed them on a footstool just above the plotted plain saying � take your pick frankie boy my loss will be your gain � well frankie lee he sat right down and put his fingers to his chin but with the cold eyes of judas on him his head began to spin � could you please not stare at me like that � he said � it s just my foolish pride but sometimes a man must be alone and this is no place to hide � well judas he just winked and said � alright i ll leave you here but you d better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want before they all disappear � � i m gonna start my picking right now just tell me where you ll be � judas pointed down the road and said � eternity � � eternity � said frankie lee with a voice as cold as ice � that s right � said judas � eternity though you might call it paradise � � i don t call it anything � said frankie lee with a smile � alright � said judas priest � i ll see you after a while � well frankie lee he sat back down feeling low and mean when just then a passing stranger burst upon the scene saying � are you frankie lee the gambler whose father is deceased well if you are there s a fellow calling you down the road and they say his name is priest � � oh yes he is my friend � said frankie lee in fright � i do recall him very well in fact he just left my sight � � yes that s the one � said the stranger as quiet as a mouse � well my message is he s down the road stranded in a house � well frankie lee he panicked he dropped everything and ran until he came up to the spot where judas priest did stand � what kind of house is this � he said � where i have come to roam � � it s not a house � says judas priest � it s not a house it s a home � well frankie lee he trembled he soon lost all control over everything which he had made while the mission bells did toll he just stood there staring at that big house as bright as any sun with four and twenty windows and a woman s face in every one well up the stairs ran frankie lee with a soulful bounding leap and foaming at the mouth he began to make his midnight creep for sixteen nights and days he raved but on the seventeenth he burst into the arms of judas priest which is where he died of thirst no one tried to say a thing when they carried him out in jest � except of course the little neighbor boy who carried him to rest and he just walked along alone with his guilt so well concealed and muttered underneath his breath � nothing is revealed � well the moral of the story the moral of this song is simply that one should never be where one does not belong so when you see your neighbor carrying something help him with his load and don t go mistaking paradise for that home across the road 
oh all the money that in my whole life i did spend be it mine right or wrongfully i let it slip gladly to my friends to tie up the time most forcefully but the bottles are done we ve killed each one and the table s full and overflowed and the corner sign says it s closing time so i ll bid farewell and be down the road oh every girl that ever i ve touched i did not do it harmfully and every girl that ever i ve hurt i did not do it knowingly but to remain as friends you need the time to make amends and stay behind and since my feet are now fast and point away from the past i ll bid farewell and be down the line oh every foe that ever i faced the cause was there before we came and every cause that ever i fought i fought it full without regret or shame but the dark does die as the curtain is drawn and somebody s eyes must meet the dawn and if i see the day i d only have to stay so i ll bid farewell in the night and be gone oh every thought that s strung a knot in my mind i might go insane if it couldn t be sprung but it s not to stand naked under unknowing eyes it s for myself and my friends my stories are sung but the time ain t tall yet on time you depend and no word is possessed by no special friend and though the line is cut it ain t quite the end i ll just bid farewell till we meet again oh a false clock tries to tick out my time to disgrace distract and bother me and the dirt of gossip blows into my face and the dust of rumors covers me but if the arrow is straight and the point is slick it can pierce through dust no matter how thick so i ll make my stand and remain as i am and bid farewell and not give a damn 
time passes slowly up here in the mountains we set beside bridges and walk beside fountains catch the wild fishes that float through the stream � time passes slowly when you re lost in a dream once i had a sweetheart she was fine and good looking we sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking staring out the window to the stars high above � time passes slow when you re searching for love ain t no reason to go in a wagon to town ain t no reason to go to the fair ain t no reason to go up ain t no reason to go down ain t no reason to go anywhere time passes slowly up here in the daylight stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day time passes slowly and fades away

far away where the soft winds blow far away from it all there is a place you go where teardrops fall far away in the stormy night far away and over the wall you are there in the flickering light where teardrops fall we banged the drum slowly and played the fife lowly you know the song in my heart in the turning of twilight in the shadows of moonlight you can show me a new place to start i ve torn my clothes and i ve drained the cup stripping away at it all thinking of you when the sun comes up where teardrops fall by rivers of blindness in love and with kindness we can hold up a toast if we meet to the cutting of fences to sharpen the senses that linger in the fireball heat roses are red violets are blue and time is beginning to crawl i just might have to come see you where teardrops fall 
i wandered again to my home in the mountain where in youth s early dawn i was happy and free i looked for my friends but i never could find them i found they were all rank strangers to me everybody i met seemed to be a rank stranger no mother or dad not a friend could i see they knew not my name and i knew not their faces i found they were all rank strangers to me � they ve all moved a way � said the voice of a stranger � to that beautiful shore by the bright crystal sea � some beautiful day i ll meet em in heaven where no one will be a stranger to me everybody i met seemed to be a rank stranger no mother or dad not a friend could i see they knew not my name and i knew not their faces i found they were all rank strangers to me 
in the still of the night in the world s ancient light where wisdom grows up in strife my bewildering brain toils in vain through the darkness on the pathways of life each invisible prayer is like a cloud in the air tomorrow keeps turning around we live and we die we know not why but i ll be with you when the deal goes down we eat and we drink we feel and we think far down the street we stray i laugh and i cry and i m haunted by things i never meant nor wished to say the midnight rain follows the train we all wear the same thorny crown soul to soul our shadows roll and i ll be with you when the deal goes down the moon gives light and shines by night i scarcely feel the glow we learn to live and then we forgive o er the road we re bound to go more frailer than the flowers these precious hours that keep us so tightly bound you come to my eyes like a vision from the skies and i ll be with you when the deal goes down i picked up a rose and it poked through my clothes i followed the winding stream i heard a deafening noise i felt transient joys i know they re not what they seem in this earthly domain full of disappointment and pain you ll never see me frown i owe my heart to you and that s saying it true and i ll be with you when the deal goes down

um when your head gets twisted and your mind grows numb when you think you re too old too young too smart or too dumb when you re lagging behind and losing your pace in the slow motion crawl or life s busy race no matter what you re doing if you start giving up if the wine don t come to the top of your cup if the wind got you sideways with one hand holding on and the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone and your train engine fire needs a new spark to catch it and the wood s easy finding but you re lazy to fetch it and your sidewalk starts curling and the street gets too long and you start walking backwards though you know that it s wrong and lonesome comes up as down goes the day and tomorrow s morning seems so far away and you feel the reins from your pony are slipping and your rope is a sliding cause your hands are dripping and your sun decked desert and evergreen valleys turn to broken down slums and trash can alleys and your sky cries water and your drain pipe s a pouring and the lightning s a flashing and the thunder s a crashing and the windows are rattling and breaking your rooftops re shaking and your whole world s a slamming and banging and your minutes of sun turn to hours of storm and to yourself you sometimes say � i never knew it was gonna be this way why didn t they tell me the day i was born � and you start getting chills and you re jumping from sweat and you re looking for something you ain t quite found yet and you re knee deep in dark water with your hands in the air and the whole world s watching with the � window peek� stare and your good gal leaves and she s long gone a flying and your heart feels sick like fish when they re frying and your jackhammer falls from your hands to your feet � but you need it badly and it lays on the street and your bell s banging loudly but you can t hear its beat and you think your ears mighta been hurt or your eyes ve turned filthy from the sight blinding dirt and you figured you failed in yesterday s rush when you were faked out and fooled while facing a four flush and all the time you re holding the three queens it s making you mad it s making you mean like in the middle of life magazine bouncing around a pinball machine and there s something on your mind that you wanna be saying that somebody someplace oughtta be hearing but it s trapped on your tongue and sealed in your head and it bothers you badly when you re laying in bed and no matter how you try you just can t say it and you re scared to your soul you just might forget it and your eyes get swimmy from the tears in your head and your pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead and the lion s mouth opens and you re staring at his teeth and his jaws start closing with you underneath and you re flat on your belly with your hands tied behind and you wish you d never taken that last detour sign you say to yourself � just what am i doing on this road i m walking on this trail i m turning on this curve i m hanging on this pathway i m strolling in this space i m taking in this air i m inhaling am i mixed up too much am i mixed up too hard why am i walking where am i running what am i saying what am i knowing on this guitar i m playing on this banjo i m flailing on this mandolin i m strumming in this song i m singing in the tune i m humming in the words that i m thinking in the words that i m writing in this ocean of hours i m all the time drinking who am i helping what am i breaking what am i giving what am i taking � but you try with your whole soul best never to think these thoughts and never to let them kinda thoughts gain ground or make your heart pound but then again you know when they re around just waiting for a chance to slip and drop down cause sometimes you hear em when the night times come creeping and you fear they might catch you sleeping and you jump from your bed from the last chapter of dreaming and you can t� you remember for the best of your thinking if that was you in the dream that was screaming and you know that it s something special you re needing you know there s no drug that ll do for the healing and no liquor in the land to stop your brain from bleeding need something special� need something special alright you need a fast flying train on a tornado track to shoot you someplace and shoot you back you need a cyclone wind on a steam engine howler that s been banging and booming and blowing forever that knows your troubles a hundred times over you need a greyhound bus that don t bar no race that won t laugh at your looks your voice or your face and by any number of bets in the book will be rolling long after the bubble gum craze you need something to open up a new door to show you something you seen before but overlooked a hundred times or more you need something to open your eyes you need something to make it known that it s you and no one else that owns that spot that you re standing that space that you re sitting that the world ain t got you beat it ain t got you licked it can t get you crazy no matter how many times you might get kicked you need something special alright you need something special to give you hope but hope s just a word that maybe you said and maybe you heard on some windy corner round a wide angled curve but that s what you need man and you need it bad and your trouble is you know it too good cause you look and you start getting the chills cause you can t find it on a dollar bill and it ain t on macy s window sill and it ain t on a real rich kid s road map and it ain t made in no fat kid s fraternity house and it ain t made in no hollywood wheat germ and it ain t on that dim lit stage with that half wit comedian on it ranting and raving and taking your money and you thinks it s funny no you can t find it neither in no night club no yacht club and it ain t in the seats of a supper club and sure as hell you re bound to tell that no matter how hard you rub you just ain t a gonna find it on your ticket stub no it ain t in the rumors people re telling you and ain t in the pimple lotion people are selling you it ain t in the cardboard box house or down any movie star s blouse and you can t find it on the golf course and uncle remus can t tell you and neither can santa claus and it ain t in the cream puff hairdo or cotton candy clothes ain t in the dime store dummies and bubble gum goons and ain t in the marshmallow noises or the chocolate cake voices that come knocking and tapping in christmas wrapping saying � ain t i pretty � and � ain t i cute look at my skin look at my skin shine look at my skin glow look at my skin laugh look at my skin cry � when you can t even sense has it got any insides these people so pretty in their ribbons and bows no you ll not now or no other day find it on the

i pity the poor immigrant who wishes he would ve stayed home who uses all his power to do evil but in the end is always left so alone that man whom with his fingers cheats and whom lies with every breath who passionately hates his life and likewise fears his death i pity the poor immigrant whose strength is spent in vain whose heaven is like ironside s whose tears are like rain who eats but is not satisfied who hears but does not see who falls in love with wealth itself and turns his back on me i pity the poor immigrant who tramples through the mud who fills his mouth with laughing and who builds his town with blood whose visions in the final end must shatter like the glass i pity the poor immigrant when his gladness comes to pass 
oh the time will come up when the winds will stop and the breeze will cease to be breathing like the stillness in the wind before the hurricane begins the hour that the ship comes in and the sea will split and the ships will hit and the sands on the shoreline will be shaking and the tide will sound and the waves will pound and the morning will be breaking the fishes will laugh as they swim out of the path and the seagulls they ll be smiling and the rocks on the sand will proudly stand the hour that the ship comes in and the words that are used for to get the ship confused will not be understood as they re spoken for the chains of the sea will have busted in the night and be buried on the bottom of the ocean a song will lift as the mainsail shifts and the boat drifts onto the shoreline and the sun will respect every face on the deck the hour that the ship comes in and the sands will roll out a carpet of gold for your weary toes to be touching and the ship s wise men will remind you once again that the whole wide world is watching oh the foes will rise with the sleep still in their eyes and they ll jerk from their beds and think they re dreaming but they ll pinch themselves and squeal wnd they ll know that it s for real the hour when the ship comes in and they ll raise their hands saying we ll meet all your demands but we ll shout from the bow your days are numbered and like pharaoh s tribe they ll be drownded in the tide and like goliath they ll be conquered

sixteen years sixteen banners united over the fields where the good shepherd grieves desperate men desperate women divided spreading their wings neath the falling leaves fortune calls i step forth from the shadows to the marketplace merchants and thieves hungry for power my last deal gone down she s smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born on midsummer s eve near the tower the cold blooded moon the captain waits above the celebration sending his thoughts to a beloved maid whose ebony face is beyond communication the captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid they shaved her head she was torn between jupiter and apollo a messenger arrived with a black nightingale i seen her on the stairs and i couldn t help but follow� � follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil i struggled to my feet i rode past destruction in the ditches with the stitches still mending neath a heart shaped tattoo renegade priests and treacherous young witches were handing out the flowers that i d given to you the palace of mirrors where dog soldiers are reflected the endless road and the wailing of chimes the empty rooms where her memory is protected where the angels voices whisper to the souls of previous times she wakes him up forty eight hours later the sun is breaking near broken chains mountain laurel and rolling rocks she s begging to know what measures he now will be taking he s pulling her down and she s clutching onto his long golden locks � gentlemen � he said � i don t need your organization i ve shined your shoes i ve moved your mountains and marked your cards but eden is burning either get ready for elimination or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards � peace will come with tranquility and the splendor on the wheels of fire but will offer no reward where the false idols fall and cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating between the king and the queen of swords

i can t understand she let go of my hand and left me here facing the wall i d sure like to know why she did go but i can t get close to her at all though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime she said she would never forget but now morning is clear it s like i ain t here she acts like we never met it s all new to me like some mystery it could even be like a myth but it s hard to think on that she s the same one that last night i was with from darkness dreams are deserted am i still dreaming yet i wish she d unlock her voice once and talk steada acting like we never met if she ain t feeling well then why don t she tell steada turning her back to my face without any doubt she seems too far out for me to return to or chase and her skirt it swayed as the guitar played her mouth was watery and wet but now something has changed for she ain t the same she just acts like we never have met if i didn t have to guess i d gladly confess to anything i mighta tried if i was with her too long or have done something wrong i d wish she d tell me what it is i ll run and hide though the night ran swirling and whirling i remember her whispering yet but evidently she don t evidently she won t she just acts like we never have met i m leaving today i ll be on my way of this i can t say very much but if you want me to i can be just like you and pretend that we never have touched and if anybody asks me � is it easy to forget � i ll say � it s easily done you just pick anyone and pretend that you never have met �
