Yes, I went down to the river on a Saturday morn,
I's looking around just to see who was born.
I spied a little chicken a-down on his knees,
I went up and yelled to him, “Please, please, please!”
She said, “Don't you tell Henry,
Don't you tell Henry,
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly.”

Yes, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve,
I's looking around just to see myself.
I looked high and low and I looked up above,
But who did I see but the one I love?
She said, “Now, don't you tell Henry,
Don't you tell Henry,
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly.”

Yeah, I went down to the whorehouse the other night,
I was looking around, I was outta sight.
I looked at a ho and I saw a mule,
I looked for a cow and I saw me a few.
They said, “Don't you tell Henry,
Don't you tell Henry
Don't you tell Henry, apple's got your fly.”
