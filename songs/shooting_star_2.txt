I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you,
You're trying to break into another world, a world I never knew.
Always kinda wondered if you ever made it through.
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of you.

I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.
Was I still the same? Had I ever became what you wanted me to be?
Did I miss the mark, overstep the line that only you could see?
I seen a shooting star tonight and I thought of me.

Listen to the engine, listen to the bell
As the last fire-truck from hell
Goes rolling by, all good people are praying.
It's the last temptation, the last account,
Last time you would hear the sermon on the mount,
The last radio is playing.

I seen a shooting star tonight slip away,
Tomorrow's gonna be another day.
Guess it's too late to say the things to you that you needed to hear me say.
I seen a shooting star tonight slip away.
