I got my back to the sun 'cause the light is too intense,
I can see what everybody in the world is up against.
Can't turn back, you can't come back, sometimes we push too far,
One day you'll open up your eyes and you'll see where we are.

Sugar baby, get on down the road, you ain't got no brains no how,
You went years without me, might as well keep going now.

Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff,
Plenty of places to hide things here if you wanna hide 'em bad enough.
I'm staying with Aunt Sally, but, you know, she's not really my aunt.
Some of these memories you can learn to live with and some of 'em you can't.

Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no brains no how,
You went years without me, you might as well keep going now.

The ladies down in Darktown, they're doing the Darktown strut,
You always got to be prepared, but you never know for what.
There ain't no limit to the amount of trouble women bring,
Love is pleasing, love is teasing, love not an evil thing.

Sugar baby, get on down the road, you ain't got no brains no how,
You went years without me, might as well keep going now.

Every moment of existence seems like some dirty trick,
Happiness can come suddenly and leave just as quick.
Any minute of the day the bubble could burst,
Try to make things better for someone, sometimes you just end up making it a thousand times worse.

Sugar baby, get on down the road, you ain't got no brains no how,
You went years without me, might as well keep going now.

Your charms have broken many a heart and mine is surely one,
You got a way of tearing a world apart. Love, see what you've done?
Just as sure as we're living, just as sure as you're born,
Look up, look up, seek your maker 'fore Gabriel blows his horn.

Sugar baby, get on down the line, you ain't got no sense no how,
You went years without me, you might as well keep going now.
