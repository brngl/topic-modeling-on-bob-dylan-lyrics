I'm going down to Rose Marie's,
She never does me wrong,
She puts it to me plain as day
And gives it to me for a song.

It's a wicked life, but what the hell?
Oh, everybody's got to eat
And I'm just the same as anyone else
When it comes to scratching for my meat.

Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
Going down to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Yeah! going to have some fun.

Now, whenever I get up and
Can't find what I need,
I just make it down to Rose Marie's
And get something quick to eat.

It's not a bad way to make a living
And I ain't complaining none
For I can blow my plum and break my rum
And then go on home and have my fun.

Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
Going to Ac––to see soft gut, going to have some fun,
Yeah! going to have some fun.

Now, if someone offers me a joke,
I just say no thanks,
I try to tell it like it is
And keep away from pranks.

Now, every time, you know, when the well breaks down,
I just go pump on it some.
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
And just set there waiting for me to come.

Going to Acapulco, going on the run,
Going down to see soft gut, going down some fun,
Yeah! going to have some fun.
