Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
If'n you don't know by now,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
It don't matter anyhow.
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
Look out your window, I'll be gone,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
Don't think twice, it's alright.

It ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
The light I never knowed,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
I'm on the dark side of the road.
Still, I wish there was something that you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
Don't think twice, it's alright.

It ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Like you never did before,
And it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
I can't a-hear you anymore.
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking all the way down the road,
I once loved a woman that's a child, I'm told,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
Don't think twice, it's alright, babe,
Don't think twice, it's alright.

So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
But goodbye's too good a word, babe,
So I'll just say, “Fare thee well.”
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
Don't think twice, it's alright,
It's alright,
It's alright,
It's alright,
It's alright,
It's alright,
It's alright,
It's alright,
It's alright,
It's alright,
Well, so don't think twice, it's alright.
