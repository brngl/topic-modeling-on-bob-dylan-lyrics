I'm beginning to hear voices and there's no one around,
Now, I'm all used up and the fields've turned brown.
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by,
Well, my love for her has taken such a long time to die.
Now, I'm waist deep, waist deep in the mist,
It's almost like–almost like I don't exist.
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.

Well, the walls of pride are high and wide,
Can't see over to the other side.
It's such a sad thing to see beauty decay,
It's sadder still to feel your heart torn away.
One look at you and I'm out of control,
Like the universe has swallowed me whole.
I'm twenty miles outta town and Cold Irons bound.

There's too many people, too many to recall,
I thought some of 'em were friends of mine, I was wrong about 'em all.
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside's mud,
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood.
I found my world, found my world in you,
But your love just hasn't proved true.
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
Twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.

Now, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds,
Reality has always had too many heads.
Some things last longer than you think they will,
Some kinda things you can never kill.
Well, it's you and you only I've been thinking about,
But you can't see in and I––it's hard looking out.
I'm twenty miles outta town and Cold Irons bound.

Well, the fat's in the fire and the water's in the tank,
Well, the whiskey's in the jar and the money's in the bank.
I tried to love and protect you because I cared,
I'm gon' remember forever the joy we've shared.
Looking at you and I'm on my bended knee,
You have no idea what you do to me.
I'm twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound,
Twenty miles outta town, Cold Irons bound.
