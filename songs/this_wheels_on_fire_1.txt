If your memory serves you well, we were going to meet again and wait,
So I'm going to unpack all my things and sit before it gets too late.
No man alive will come to you with another tale to tell
And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well.
This wheel's on fire, rolling down the road,
Best notify my next of kin this wheel shall explode!

If your memory serves you well, I was going to confiscate your lace
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot and hide it in your case
If I knew for sure that it was yours – but it was, oh, so hard to tell! –
And you know that we shall meet again if your memory serves you well.
This wheel's on fire, 's rolling down the road,
Best notify my next of kin this wheel shall explode!

If your memory serves you well, you'll remember you're the one
That called on me to call on them to get you your favors done
And, after every plan had failed and there was nothing more to tell,
You knew that we should meet again if your memory served you well.
This wheel's on fire, it's rolling down the road,
Best notify my next of kin that this wheel shall explode!
