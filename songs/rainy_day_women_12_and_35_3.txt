They'll stone you when you're trying to be so good,
Stone you just like they said they would,
Stone you and they'll say that it's the end,
Stone you, they'll be back again.
I would not feel so all alone,
Everybody must get stoned.

They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table,
Stone you when you are young and able,
Stone you and say good luck,
Stone you just like you got hit by a truck,
But I would not feel so all alone,
Everybody must get stoned.

They'll stone and they'll be back for more,
Stone you and then they'll close the door,
Stone you and say that it's the end,
Stone you and they'll be back again.
I would not feel so all alone,
Everybody must get stoned.
