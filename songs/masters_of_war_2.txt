Come, you masters of war, you that build the big guns,
You that build the death planes, you that build the big bombs-a,
You that hide behind walls, you that hide behind desks,
I just want you to know I can a-see through your mask.

You that never done nothing but build to destroy,
You play with my world like it's your little toy,
Put a gun in my hand and you hide from my eyes,
And you turn and run farther when the fast bullets a-fly.

Like Judas of old, you lie and deceive,
A world war can be won, you want me to believe,
But I see through your eyes and I see through your brain
Like I see through the water that runs down my drain.

You fasten the trigger for the others to fire,
Then you set back and watch while the death count gets higher,
You hide in your mansion while the young people's blood
Flows outta their bodies and is buried in the mud.

Let me ask you one question: Is your money that good?
Will it buy you forgiveness? Do you think that it could?
I think you will find, when your death takes its toll,
All of your ... and let's talk about your soul.

And I hope that you die and your death will come soon,
I will follow your casket on the pale afternoon
And I'll watch while you're lowered down to your deathbed
And I'll stand over your grave till I'm sure that you're dead.
