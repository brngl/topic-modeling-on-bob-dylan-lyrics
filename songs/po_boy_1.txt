Man came to the door, I said, “For whom are you looking?”
Says, “Your wife.” I said, “She's busy in the kitchen cooking.”
Poor boy, where you been?
I already told you, won't tell you again.

I say, “How much you want for that?” I go into the store.
Man says, “Three dollars.” “Alright,” I say, “will you take four?”
Poor boy never say die,
Things will be alright by and by.

Working like in the mainline, working like the devil,
The game is the same, it's just up on another level.
Poor boy dressed in black,
Police at your back.

Poor boy in a red-hot town
Out beyond the twinkling stars,
Riding first-class train, making the round,
Trying to keep from falling between the cars.

Othello told Desdemona, “I'm cold, cover me with a blanket.
By the way, what happened to that poison wine?”
She said, “I gave it to you, drink it.”
Poor boy laying 'em straight,
Picking up the cherries falling off the plate.

Time and love has branded me with its claws,
Had to go to Florida, dodging them Georgia laws.
Poor boy in the hotel called the “Palace of Gloom”,
Call down to room service, says, “Send up a room.”

My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer,
My father was a traveling salesman, I never met him.
When my mother died, my uncle took me in, he run a funeral parlor,
He did a lot of nice things for me and I won't forget him.

All I know is that I'm thrilled by your kiss,
I don't know any more than this.
Poor boy picking up sticks,
Build you a house out of mortar and bricks.

Knocking on the door, I say, “Who is it? Where you from?”
Man said, “Freddy.” I said, “Freddy who?” He said, “Freddy or not, here I come.”
Poor boy 'neath the stars that shine,
Washing them dishes, feeding them swine.
