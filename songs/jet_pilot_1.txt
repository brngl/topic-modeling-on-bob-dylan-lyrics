Well, she's got jet-pilot eyes from her hips on down,
All the bombardiers're trying to force her outta town.
She's five-feet-nine and she carries a monkey wrench,
She weighs more by the foot than she does by the inch.
She got all the downtown boys all at her command,
But you got to watch her closely 'cause she ain't no woman, she's a man.
