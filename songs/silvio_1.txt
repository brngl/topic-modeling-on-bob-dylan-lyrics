Stake my future on a hell of a past,
Looks like tomorrow is a-coming on fast,
Ain't complaining 'bout what I got,
I seen better times, but who has not?

Silvio, silver and gold
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
Silvio, I gotta go
Find out something only dead men know.

Honest as the next jade rolling that stone,
When I come a-knocking, don't throw me no bone.
I'm an old boll weevil looking for a home
And, if you don't like me, you can leave me alone.
I can snap my fingers and require the rain
From a clear, blue sky and turn it off again,
I can stroke your body and relieve your pain,
Charm the whistle off an evening train.

Silvio, silver and gold
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
Silvio, I gotta go
Find out something only dead men know.

Give what I got until I got no more,
I take what I gets and I even the score,
You know I love you and, furthermore,
When it's time to go, you got an open door.
I can tell you fancy, I can tell you plain,
You give something up for everything you gain.
Since every pleasure's got an edge of pain,
Pay for your ticket and don't complain.

Silvio, silver and gold
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
Silvio, I gotta go,
Go find out something only dead men know.

One of these days – and it won't be long –
Going down in the valley and sing my song.
Gonna sing it loud, sing it strong,
Let the echo decide if I was right or wrong.

Silvio, silver and gold
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
Silvio, I gotta go
Find out something only dead men know.

Silvio, silver and gold
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
Silvio, I gotta go
Find out something only dead men know.

Silvio, silver and gold
Won't buy back the beat of a heart grown cold,
Silvio, I gotta go
Find out something only dead men know.
