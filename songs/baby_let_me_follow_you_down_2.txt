Baby, let me follow you down,
Baby, let me follow you down,
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
If you just let me follow you down.

I'll buy you a diamond ring,
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown,
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
If you just let me follow you down.

Can I come home with you?
Baby, can I come home with you?
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
If you just let me come home with you.

I'll buy you rope and twine,
Honey, just for you to climb,
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
If you just once drive me outta my mind.

I'll buy you a ... skirt,
I'll buy you a velvet shirt,
Yes, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
If it just don't make me hurts.

Baby, let me follow you down,
Baby, let me follow you down,
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
If you just let me follow you down.
Baby, let me follow you down,
Baby, let me follow you down,
Well, I'll do anything in this God-Almighty world
If you just let me follow you down.
