“Not I,” said the referee,
“Don't point your finger at me.
I coulda stopped it in the eighth
And maybe kept him from his fate,
But the crowd woulda booed, I'm sure,
At not getting their money's worth.
It's too bad he had to go,
But there was a pressure on me too, you know.
It wasn't me that made him fall,
You can't blame me at all.”

“Not us,” said the angry crowd,
Whose screams filled the arena loud,
“It's too bad he had to die that night,
We just like to see a good, old-fashioned fight.
We didn't mean for him to meet his death,
We just wanted to see some sweat –
There ain't nothing wrong in that.
It wasn't us that made him fall,
You can't blame us at all.”

“Not me,” said his manager,
Puffing on a big cigar,
“It's hard to say, it's hard to tell,
I always thought that he was well.
It's too bad for his wife and kids he's dead,
But, if he was sick, he shoulda said.
It wasn't me that made him fall,
You can't blame me at all.”

“Not me,” said the gambling man
With his ticket stub still in his hand,
“It wasn't me that knocked him down,
My hands didn't touch him none,
I didn't commit no ugly sin –
Anyway, I put money on him to win.
It wasn't me that made him fall,
You can't blame me at all.”

“Not me,” said the boxing writer,
Who pounds the print in his old typewriter,
Saying, “Boxing is here to stay,
There's just as much foot in––danger in a football game,” 
Saying, “Fist-fighting is here to stay,
It's just the old American way.
It wasn't me that made him fall,
You can't blame me at all.”

“Not me,” said the man whose fists
Laid him low in a cloud of mist,
Who came here from Cuba's door
Where boxing ain't allowed no more,
“I hit him, I hit him, yes, it's true,
But that's what I am paid to do.
Don't say ‘murder', don't say ‘kill',
It was destiny, it was God's will.”
