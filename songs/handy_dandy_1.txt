Handy-dandy, controversy surrounds him,
He been around the world and back again,
Something in the moonlight still hounds him,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy.

Handy-dandy, if every bone in his body was a-broken, he would never admit it,
He got an all-girl orchestra and, when he says
“Strike up the band,” they hit it,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy.

You'll say, “What are you made of?”
He'll say, “Can you repeat what you said?”
You'll say, “What are you afraid of?”
He'll say, “Nothing neither 'live nor dead.”

Handy-dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money,
He'll say, “Oh, darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?”
She'll say, “You got all the time in the world, honey.”
Handy-dandy, Handy-dandy.

He got that clear crystal fountain,
He got that soft, silky skin,
He got that fortress on the mountain
With no doors or windows, so no thieves can break in.

Handy-dandy, sitting with a girl named Nancy in a garden feeling kind of lazy.
He say, “Oh, you want a gun? I'll give you one.” 
She said, “Boy, you talking crazy.”
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Handy-dandy, pour him another brandy.

Handy-dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow,
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table,
He said, “Ok, boys, I'll see you tomorrow.”
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Handy-dandy, just like sugar and candy,
Handy-dandy, handy-dandy.
