Do you love me or are you just extending goodwill?
Do you need me half as bad as you say or are you just feeling guilt?
I've been burned before and I know the score, so you won't hear me complain.
Will I be able to count on you or is your love in vain?

Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind, or must I explain?
Will you let me be myself or is your love in vain?

Well, I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,
I've been in and out of a-happiness,
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings,
And I've a-never been too impressed.

Alright, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you.
If I'm a fool, you can have the night â€“ you can have the morning, too.
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
Are you willing to risk it all or is your love in vain?

Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow, do you understand my pain?
