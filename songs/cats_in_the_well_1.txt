Cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
The cat's in the well, the wolf is looking down,
He got his big, bushy tail dragging all over the ground.

Cat's in the well, the gentle lady is asleep,
Cat's in the well, gentle lady is asleep,
She ain't hearing a thing, silence is a-sticking her deep.

Cat's in the well and grief is showing its face,
The world's being slaughtered, it's such a bloody disgrace.

Cat's in the well, horse is going bumpety-bump,
Cat's in the well and the horse is going bumpety-bump,
Back-alley Sally's doing the American jump.

Cat's in the well and papa is reading the news,
His hair is falling out and all of his daughters need shoes.

The cat's in the well and the barn is full of bull,
The cat's in the well and the barn is full of the bull,
The night is so long and the table is oh so full.

Cat's in the well and the servant is at the door,
The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war.

The cat's in the well, the leaves are starting to fall,
Cat's in the well, leaves are starting to fall,
Goodnight, my love, may the lord have mercy on us all.
