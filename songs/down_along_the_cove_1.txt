Down along the cove I spied my true love coming my way.
Down along the cove I spied my true love coming my way.
I said, “Lord, have mercy! Mama, it sure is good to see you coming today!”

Down along the cove I spied my little bundle of joy.

She said, “Lord, have mercy! Honey, I'm so glad you're my boy!”

Down along the cove we walk together hand in hand.
Down along the cove we walk together hand in hand.
Everybody watching us a-go by knows we're in love, yes, they understand.
