Mama, take this badge off of me,
I can't use it anymore.
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.

Mama, wipe the blood from my face,
I'm sick and tired of the war.
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.

Mama, put my guns in the ground,
I can't shoot them anymore.
That long, black train is pulling on down,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.

Mama, take this badge off of me.
