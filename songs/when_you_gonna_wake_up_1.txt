God don't make promises that He don't keep,
You got some big dreams, baby, but in order to dream you gotta still be asleep.
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?

Counterfeit philosophies have polluted all of your thoughts,
Karl Marx has got you by the throat and Henry Kissinger's got you tied up into knots.
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?

You got innocent men in jail, your insane asylums are filled,
You got unrighteous doctors dealing drugs that'll never kill your ills.
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?

You got men who can't hold their peace, women who can't control their tongue,
The rich seduce the poor and the old are seduced by the young.
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?

Adulterers in churches and pornography in the schools,
You got gangsters in power and lawbreakers making rules.
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

Spiritual advisors and gurus to guide your every move,
Instant inner peace and every step you take's got to be approved.
When you gonna wake up, said when you gonna wake up,
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?

Do you ever wonder just what God requires?
You think He's just an errand boy to satisfy your wandering desires?
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
When you gonna wake up and strengthen the things that remain?

You can't take it with you and you know it's too worthless to be sold,
They tell you “Time is money” as if your life was worth its weight in gold.

There's a Man on a cross and He be crucified for you,
Believe in His power – that's about all you got to do.
When you gonna wake up, when you gonna wake up,
When you gonna wake up, strengthen the things that remain?
