Down the street the dogs are barking and the day is getting dark,
As the night comes in a-falling, the dogs will lose their bark,
The silent night will shatter from the sounds inside my mind
As I am one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.

From the crossroads of my doorstep my eyes begin to fade
And I turn my head back to the room where my love and I have laid
Till I gaze back to the streets, the sidewalks, and the sign
And know I'm one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.

It's a restless, hungry feeling and it don't mean no one no good
When everything that I'm saying you could say it just as good.
You are right from your side and I'm right from mine,
We're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles behind.

I've no right to be here if you've no right to stay
Until we're both one too many mornings and a thousand miles away.
