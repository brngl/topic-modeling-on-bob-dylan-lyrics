The trail is dark and dusty, the road, it's kind of rough,
But the good road is a-waiting and, boys, it ain't far off.

Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
Paths of victory we shall walk.

I walked out to the valley, I turned my head up high,
I seen that silver lining that was hanging in the sky.

Trails of troubles, toads of battles,
Paths of victory we shall walk.

The evening dust was rolling, I's a-walking down the track,
There was a one-way wind a-blowing, it was blowing at my back.

Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
Paths of victory we shall walk.

The gravel road is bumpy, it's a hard, old road to ride,
But the clear road's of yonder with the cinders on the side.

Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
Paths of victory we shall walk.

The morning train was moving, the humming of its wheels
Told me of a new day coming across the field.

Trails of troubles, roads of battles,
Paths of victory we shall walk.
