I sung the song slowly as she stood in the shadows,
She stepped to the light as my silver strings spun.
She called with her eyes to the tune I's a-playing,
But the song, it was long and I'd only begun.

Through a bullet of light her face was reflecting
The fast, fading words that rolled from my tongue.
With a long-distance look her eyes was on fire,
But the song, it was long and there was more to be sung.

My eyes danced a circle across her clear outline,
With her head tilted sideways she called me again.
As the tune drifted out, she breathed hard through the echo,
But the song, it was long and it was far to the end.

I glanced at my guitar and played it, pretending
That of all the eyes out there I could see none,
As her thoughts pounded hard like the pierce of an arrow,
But the song, it was long and it had to get done.

As the tune finally folded, I laid down the guitar
And looked for the girl who'd stared for so long,
But her shadow was missing for all of my searching,
So I picked up my guitar and began the next song.
