Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed.
Whatever colors you have a-in your mind,
I'll show them to you and you'll see them shine.

Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile,
Right up until the break of day let me see you make him smile.
His clothes are dirty, but his a-hands are clean
And you are the best thing that he's ever seen.

Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile –
Why wait any longer for the world to begin?
You can have your cake and eat it, too.
Why wait any longer for the one you love
When he's standing in front of you?

Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed,
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
I long to see you in the morning light,
I long to reach out for you in the dead of the night –
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead.
