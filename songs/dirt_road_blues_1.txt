Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
Gon' walk down that dirt road till someone lets me ride,
If I can't find my baby, I'm gonna run away and hide.

Well, I been pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Pacing 'round the room hoping maybe she'd come back,
Well, I been praying for salvation, laying 'round in a one-room country-shack.

Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
Gon' walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed,
Till there's nothing left to see, till the chains have been shattered and I've been freed.

Well, I been looking at my shadow, I been watching the clouds up above,
Looking at my shadow, watching the clouds up above,
Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love.

Gon' walk on that dirt road till everything becomes the same,
Gon' walk down that road till everything becomes the same,
Gonna keep on walking till I hear her holler out my name.
