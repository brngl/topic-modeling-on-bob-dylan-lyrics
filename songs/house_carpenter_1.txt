“Well met, well met, my own, true love.”
“Well met, well met,” cried she.
“I've just returned from the salt, salt sea
And it's all for the love of thee.”

“I could have married a king's daughter there,
She would have married me,
But I have forsaken my king's daughter there,
It's all for the love of thee.”

“Well, if you could have married a king's daughter there,
I'm sure you're the one to blame
For I am married to a house carpenter
And I'm a-sure he's a fine, young man.”

“Forsake, forsake your house carpenter
And come away with me.
I'll take you to where the green grass grows
On the shores of sunny Italy.”

So up she picked her babies three
And give them kisses, one, two, three,
Saying, “Take good care of your daddy while I'm gone
And keep him good company.”

Well, they were sailing about two weeks –
I'm sure it was not three –
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck,
Saying wants company.

“Well, are you weeping for your house and home
Or are you weeping for your babe?”
“Well, I'm not weeping for my house carpenter,
I'm weeping for my babies three.”

“Oh, what are those hills yonder, my love?
They look as white as snow.”
“Those are the hills of heaven, my love,
You and I'll never know.”

“What are those hills yonder, my love?
They look as dark as night.”
“Those are the hills of hell-fire, my love,
Where you and I will unite.”

Oh, twice around went the gallant ship –
I'm sure it was not three –
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea.
