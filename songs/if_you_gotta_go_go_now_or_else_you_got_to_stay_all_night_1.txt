Listen to me, baby, there's something you must see,
I wanna be with you, girl, if you wanna be with me,
But, if you gotta go, it's alright,
But, if you got to go, go now or else you got to stay all night.

It ain't that I'm questioning you to take part in any kinda quiz,
It's just that I haven't got no watch and you keep asking me what time it is,
So, if you gotta go, it's alright,
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you gotta stay all night.

I am just a poor boy, baby, trying to connect,
But I certainly don't want you thinking that I haven't got any respect,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
But, if you gotta go, go now or else you got to stay all night.

It ain't that I'm wanting anything you never gave before,
It's just that I'll be sleeping soon and it'll be too dark for you to find the door,
So, if you got to go, it's alright,
But, if you got to go, go now or else you got to stay all night.
