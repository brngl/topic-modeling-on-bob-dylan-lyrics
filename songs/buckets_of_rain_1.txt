Buckets of rain, buckets of tears,
Got all them buckets coming outta my ears,
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand,
You got all the love, a-honey baby, I can stand.

I been meek and hard like an oak,
I've seen pretty people disappear like smoke,
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear –
If you want me, a-honey baby, I'll be here.

I like the smile in your fingertips,
I like the way that you move your hips,
I like the cool way you look at me,
Everything about you is bringing me misery.

Little red wagon, little red bike,
I ain't no monkey, but I know what I like,
I like the way you love me strong and slow,
I'm taking you with me, a-honey baby, where I go.

Life is sad, life is a bust,
All you can do is do what you must,
You do what you must do and you do it well –
I do it for you, a-honey baby, can't you tell?
