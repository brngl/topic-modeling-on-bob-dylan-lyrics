What's the matter with me? I don't have much to say,
Daylight sneaking through the window and I'm still in this all-night caf√©.
Walking to and fro beneath the moon out to where the trucks are rolling slow
To sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.

Wish I was back in the city instead of this old bank of sand
With the sun beating down over the chimney-tops and the one I love so close at hand.
If I had wings and I could fly, I know where I would go,
But right now I'll just sit here so contentedly and watch the river flow.

People disagreeing on just about everything, yeah, makes you stop and wonder why,
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street who just couldn't help but cry;
Oh, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow.

People disagreeing everywhere you look, makes you wanna stop and read a book,
Why only yesterday I saw somebody on the street that was a-really shook;
Well, but this old river keeps on rolling, though,
No matter what gets in the way and which way the wind does blow
And, as long as it does, I'll just sit here and watch the river flow,
Watch the river flow,
Watching the river flow,
Watching the river flow,
But I'll just sit down on this bank of sand and watch the river flow.
