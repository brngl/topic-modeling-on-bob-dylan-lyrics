I got a wife and five little children,
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan.
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.

The boiler busted and the whistler squalled,
The captain gone through the hole in the wall.
Oh, Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.

The engine gave a crack and the whistle gave a squall.
The engineer gone through the hole in the wall.
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.

The Yankee built boats to shoot them rebels,
My gun's steady, gonna hold it level.
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.

I got a wife and five little children,
I'm gonna take a trip on the big McMillan.
Sarah Jane, Sarah Jane,
Ain't nothing to do but to set down and sing and rock about my Sarah Jane.
