Nothing 'round here to me that's sacred, 'cept you, yeah, you,
There's nothing 'round here to me that matters, 'cept you, yeah, you.
You're the one that reaches me, you're the one that I admire,
Every time we meet together, I feel like I'm on fire,
Nothing matters to me and there's nothing I desire, 'cept you, yeah, you.

Nothing 'round here I care to try for, 'cept you, yeah, you,
Got nothing here to live or die for, except you, yeah, you.
There's a hymn I used to hear in the churches all the time,
Make me feel so good inside, so peaceful, so sublime.
Now there's nothing that reminds me of that old, familiar chime, except you, yeah, you.

Used to run in the cemetery, dance and run and sing when I was a child
And it never seemed strange.
Now I just pass mournfully by that place where bones of life are piled,
I know something is changed.
I'm a stranger here and no one sees me, except you, yeah, you,
Nothing anymore seems to please me, except you, yeah, you,
Nothing hypnotizes me or holds me in a spell,
Everything runs by me just like water from a well,
Everybody wants my attention, everybody got something to sell, except you, yeah, you,
I'm in love with you!
