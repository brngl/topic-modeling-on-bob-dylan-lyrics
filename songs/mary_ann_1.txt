Oh, fare thee well, my own true love,
Fare thee well but for a while,
The ship is waiting and the wind blows high
And I am bound away for the sea, Mary Ann.

Ten thousand miles away from home,
Ten thousand miles or more â€“
The sea may freeze and the earth may burn
If I never no more return to you, Mary Ann.

Oh, don't you see that crow fly high?
She'll surely turn to white,
If ever I prove false to you,
Let the day turn to night, my dear Mary Ann.

Oh, if I had a flask of gin and sugar here for two
And a great, big bowl for to mix it in,
I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann,
Yes, I'd pour a drink for you, my dear Mary Ann.
