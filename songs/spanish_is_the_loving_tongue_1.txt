Broke her heart, lost my own,
Adiós, mi corazón.

Spanish is the loving tongue,
Soft as music, light as spring.
It was a girl I learned it from,
Living down Sonora way.
Well, I don't look much like a lover,
Still I say her love-words over
Mostly when I'm all alone,
Mi amor, mi corazón.

Haven't seen her since that night –
I can't cross the line, you know,
They want me for a gambling fight.
Like as not, it's better so,
Still I've always kind of missed her
Since that last, sad night I kissed her,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
Adiós, mi corazón,
Broke her heart, lost my own,
Adiós, mi corazón,
Adiós, mi corazón.
