Mama, take this badge off of me,
I can't use it anymore.
It's getting dark, too dark to see
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Just like so many times before.

Mama, wipe the blood outta my face,
I just can't see through it anymore.
Got a long, black feeling and it's hard to trace
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Just like so many times before.

Mama, lay my guns into the ground,
I just can't fight 'em anymore.
That long, black train is pulling on down
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Just like so many times before.
