Twilight on the frozen lake, a north wind about to break
On footprints in the snow and silence down below.

You're beautiful beyond words,
You're beautiful to me,
You could make me cry, never say goodbye,
Because my dreams are made of iron and steel
With a big bouquet of the roses
Hanging down from the heavens to the ground.

The crashing waves roll over me
As I stand upon the sand
And wait for you to come and grab hold of my hand.

Oh, baby, baby, baby blue,
You'll change your last name, too,
You've turned your hair to brown, love to see it hanging down.
