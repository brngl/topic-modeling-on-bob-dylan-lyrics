Your breath is sweet, your eyes are like two jewels in the sky,
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth on the pillow where you lie,
I don't sense affection â€“ no, no gratitude or love,
Your loyalty is a-not to me, but to the stars above.
One more cup of coffee for the road,
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.

Your daddy, he's an outlaw and a wanderer by trade,
He'll teach you how to pick and choose and how to throw the blade,
He oversees his kingdom, where no stranger does intrude,
His voice, it trembles as he calls out for another plate of food.
One more cup of coffee for the road,
One more cup of coffee 'fore I go to the valley below.

Your sister sees the future like your mama and yourself,
She never learned to read or write, there's no books upon her shelf,
And her pleasure knows no limits, her voice is like a meadowlark,
But her heart is like an ocean, so mysterious and dark.
One more cup of coffee for the road,
One more cup of coffee before I go to the valley below.
