If not for you,
Babe, I couldn't find the door,
Couldn't even see the floor,
I'd be sad and blue,
If not for you.

If not for you,
The night would see me wide awake,
The day would surely have to break,
But it would not be new,
If not for you.

If not for you, my sky would fall,
Rain would gather too.
Without your love, I'd be nowhere at all,
I'd be lost if not for you.

If not for you,
The winter would hold no spring,
I couldn't hear the robin sing,
I just wouldn't have a clue,
If not for you.
