Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart,
Without a love of my own.

Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for,
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for.

And suddenly there appeared before me
The only one my arms could ever hold,
I heard someone whisper, “Please adore me,”
And when I looked, my moon had turned to gold.

Blue moon, now, I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart,
Without a love of my own,
Without a love of my own.
