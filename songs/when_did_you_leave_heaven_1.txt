When did you leave heaven?
How could they let you go?
How's everything in heaven?
I'd like to know.

Why did you trade heaven
For all these earthly things?
Where did you hide your halo?
Where did you lose your wings?

Have they missed you?
Can you get back in?
If I kiss you, would it be a sin?
I am only human, but you are so divine.
When did you leave heaven, angel mine?
