Went out last night just to take a little round,
I met my little Sadie and I brought her down,
I run right home and I went to bed
With a .44 smokeless under my head.

I began to think of what a deed I'd done,
I grabbed my hat and I began to run,
I made a good run, but I run too slow:
They overtook me down in Jericho.

Standing on a corner a-just ringing my bell,
Up stepped the sheriff from Thomasville,
He says, “Young man, is your name Brown?
Remember, you blowed little Sadie down.”

“Oh, yes, sir, my name is Lee,
I murdered little Sadie in first degree,
First degree and second degree,
If you got any papers, will you serve 'em to me?”

Well, they took me downtown and they dressed me in black,
They put me on a train and they sent me back.
I had no one for to go my bail,
They crammed me back into the county jail –
Oh, yes, they did.
Now, the judge and the jury, they took their stand,
The judge had the papers in his right hand –
Forty-one days, forty-one nights,
Forty-one years to wear the ball and the stripes –
Oh, no!

I went out last night to take a little round,
I met little Sadie and I blowed her down,
I run right home and I went to bed,
A .44 smokeless under my head.
