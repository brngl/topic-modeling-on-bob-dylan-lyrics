You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand,
See somebody naked, you say, “Who is that man?”
You try so hard, but you don't understand
What you'll say when you get home.
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?

You hand in a back door to go––“Is this––this where it is?”
Somebody points his finger at you and says, “It's his.”
You say, “What's mine?” Someone else says, “Where what is?”
You say, “Oh, no, am I here all alone?”
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?

You hand in your ticket to go see the geek,
Who walks up to you when he hears you speak
And says, “How does it feel to be such a freak?”
You say, “Impossible!” as he hand you a--a bone.
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?

You have many contacts out there among the lumberjacks,
Get you facts when someone attacks your imagination.
No one has any respect, anyway they just expect
You to sign your check to tax-deductible charity organizations, oh!

You walk into the room like a camel and you frown,
You put your eyes in your pocket, you put your nose in the ground.
There oughtta be a law against you coming around,
Remember before you come, at least please first telephone.
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
Something is happening, but you don't know what it is, do you, Mr. Jones?
