Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her where I am,
Take a message to Mary, but don't say I'm in a jam –
You can tell her that I had to see the world, tell her that my ship's at sail,
You can say she'd better not wait for me, but don't tell her I'm in jail,
Oh, don't tell her I'm in jail.

Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her what I've done,
Please don't mention the stage coach and the shot from a careless gun –
You can tell her that I had to change my plans and cancel out the wedding-day,
But please don't mention my lonely cell where I'm gonna pine away
Until my dying-day.

Take a message to Mary, but don't tell her all you know,
My heart is aching for Mary, Lord knows I miss her so –
Just tell her that I went to Timbuktu, tell her that I'm searching for gold,
You can say she'd better find someone new to cherish and to hold –
Oh, Lord, this cell is cold!
