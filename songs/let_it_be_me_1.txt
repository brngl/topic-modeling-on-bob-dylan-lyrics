I bless the day I found you,
I want my arms around you,
So I beg you: let it be me.

A-don't take a-this heaven from one,
If you must cling to someone,
Now and forever let it be me.

Each time we meet, love,
I find complete love;
Without your sweet love,
What would life be?

So, never leave me lonely,
Tell me that you love me only,
And a-say you'll always let it be me.

So, never leave me lonely,
Tell me that you love me only,
And say you'll always let it be me.
