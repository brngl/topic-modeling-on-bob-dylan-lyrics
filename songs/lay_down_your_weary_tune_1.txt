Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings no voice can hope to hum.

Struck by the sounds before the sun, I knew the night had gone,
The morning breeze like a bugle blew against the drums of dawn.
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings no voice can hope to hum.

The ocean wild like an organ played, the seaweeds wove its strands,
The crashing waves like cymbals clashed against the rocks and sands.
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings no voice can hope to hum.

I stood unwound beneath the skies and clouds unbound by laws,
The crying rain like a trumpet sang and asked for no applause.
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings no voice can hope to hum.

The last of leaves fell from the trees and clung to a new love's breast,
The branches bare like a banjo moaned to the winds that listened the best.

I gazed down in the river's mirror and watched its winding strum,
The water smooth ran like a hymn and like a harp did hum.
Lay down your weary tune, lay down, lay down the song you strum
And rest yourself 'neath the strength of strings no voice can hope to hum.
