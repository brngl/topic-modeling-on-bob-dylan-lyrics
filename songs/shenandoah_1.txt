Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
Look away, you rolling river,
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you –
Look away, we're bound away across the wide Missouri.

Now, the Missouri is a mighty river –
Look away, you rolling river,
Indians camp along her border –
Look away, we're bound away across the wide Missouri.

Well, a white man loved an Indian maiden –
Look away, you rolling river,
With notions his canoe was laden –
Look away, we're bound away across the wide Missouri.

Oh, Shenandoah, I love your daughter –
Look away, you rolling river,
It was for her I'd cross the water –
Look away, we're bound away across the wide Missouri.

For seven long years I courted Sally –
Look away, you rolling river,
Seven more years I longed to have her –
Look away, we're bound away across the wide Missouri.

Well, it's fare thee well, my dear, I'm bound to leave you –
Look away, you rolling river,
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you –
Look away, we're bound away across the wide Missouri.
