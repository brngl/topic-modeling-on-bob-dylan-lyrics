There's a whole lotta people suffering tonight from the disease of conceit,
Whole lotta people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit,
Come right down the highway, straight down the line,
Rips into your senses, through your body and your mind,
Nothing about it that's sweet, the disease of conceit.

There's a whole lotta hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Whole lotta hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit,
Steps into your room, eats into your soul,
Over your senses you have no control,
Ain't nothing too discreet 'bout the disease of conceit.

There's a whole lotta people dying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Whole lotta people crying tonight from the disease of conceit,
Comes right outta nowhere and you're down for the count,
From the outside world the pressure will mount,
Turn you into a piece of meat, the disease of conceit.

Conceit is a disease that the doctors got no cure,
They've done a lot of research on it, but what it is they're still not sure.

There's a whole lotta people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit,
Whole lotta people seeing double tonight from the disease of conceit,
Give you delusions of grandeur and an evil eye,
Give you idea that you're too good to die,
Then they bury you from your head to your feet from the disease of conceit.
