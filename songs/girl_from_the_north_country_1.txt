If you're traveling in the north country fair,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
Remember me to the one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine.

If you go when the snowflakes storm,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
Please see she has a coat so warm,
To keep her from the howling winds.

Please see if her hair hangs long,
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long
For that's the way I remember her best.

I'm wondering if she remembers me at all.
Many times I've often prayed
In the darkness of my night,
In the brightness of my day.

So, if you're traveling in the north country fair,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
Remember me to the one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine.
