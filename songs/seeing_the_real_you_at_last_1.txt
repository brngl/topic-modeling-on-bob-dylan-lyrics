Well, I thought that the rain would cool things down, but it looks like it don't.
I'd like to get you to change your mind, but it looks like you won't.
From now on I'll be busy, ain't going nowhere fast,
I'm just glad it's over, I'm seeing the real you at last.

Well, I risked my neck for you. Didn't I take chances?
Didn't I rise above all the most unfortunate circumstances?
Well, I have had some rotten nights, didn't think that they would pass,
I'm just thankful and grateful to be seeing the real you at last – oh!

I'm hungry and I'm irritable and I'm tired of this bag of tricks.
At one time, there was nothing wrong with me that you could not fix.
Well, I sailed through the storm strapped to the mast,
But our time has come and I'm seeing the real you at last.

When I met you, baby, you didn't show no visible scars,
You could ride like Annie Oakley, you could shoot like Belle Starr.
Well, I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble – trouble always comes to pass,
All I care, though, 'bout now is if I'm seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!

Well, I'm gonna quit this baby-talk now – I guess I should have known.
I got troubles, I think maybe you got troubles, I think maybe we'd better leave each other alone.
Whatever you gonna do please do it fast,
I'm still trying to get used to seeing the real you at last – oh, yes, I am!
