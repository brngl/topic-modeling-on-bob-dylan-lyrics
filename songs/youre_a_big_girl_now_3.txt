Our conversation was short and sweet,
It nearly swept me off of my feet –
Hmm, and I'm back in the rain,
Hmm, and you are on dry land,
You made it there somehow,
You're a big girl now.

Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
And I'm just like that bird,
Oh, singing just for you,
Hmm, I hope that you can hear,
Hear me singing through these tears.

Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
Oh, I know where I can find you,
Oh, in somebody's room,
Hmm, it's a price I have to pay,
You're a big girl all the way.

Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
Oh, but what a shame! that all we've shared can't last.
I can change, I swear,
Hmm, see what you can do,
Hmm, I can make it through,
You can make it too.

A change in the weather can be extreme,
But it ain't like changing horses in midstream.
I'm going out of my mind,
Hmm, with a pain that stops and starts,
Ooh-ah, like a corkscrew to my heart
Ever since we've been apart.
