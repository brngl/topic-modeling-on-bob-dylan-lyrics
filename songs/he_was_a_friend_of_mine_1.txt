He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
Every time I think about him now, lord, I just can't keep from crying
'Cause he was a friend of mine.

He died on the road, he died on the road.
He never had enough money to pay his room or board
And he was a friend of mine.

I stole away and cried, I stole away and cried
'Cause I never had too much money and I never been quite satisfied
And he was a friend of mine.

He never done no wrong, he never done no wrong,
A thousand miles from home and he never harmed no one
And he was a friend of mine.

He was a friend of mine, he was a friend of mine,
Every time I hear his name, lord, I just can't keep from crying
'Cause he was a friend of mine.
