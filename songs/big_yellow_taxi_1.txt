They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
A pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging, hot spot.
Don't it always go to show
You never know what you got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.

They took all the trees, they put 'em in a tree museum,
They charge the people a dollar and a half just to see 'em.
Don't it always go to show
You never know what you got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.

Hey, farmer, farmer, put away that DDT,
Give me spots on my apples, but leave me the birds and the bees please.
Don't it always a-go to show
You never know what you got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.

Late last night I heard my screen door slam,
A big, yellow bulldozer took away the house and land.
Don't it always a-go to show
You never know what you got till it's gone?
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot,
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
Paved paradise, they put up a parking lot.
