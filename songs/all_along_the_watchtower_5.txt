“There must be some way out of here,” said the joker to the thief,
“There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.
Businessmen, they drink my wine and plowmen dig my earth,
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth.”

“No reason to get excited,” the thief, he kindly spoke,
“There's many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.
You and I, we've been through that, this is not our fate.
Let us not talk falsely now, you know the hour's getting late.”

All along the watchtower princes kept the view
All the women came and went, barefoot servants too.
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,
Two riders were approaching, and the wind began to howl, oh!
