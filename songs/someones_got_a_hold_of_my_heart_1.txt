They say eat, drink, and be merry, take the bull by the horns,
I keep seeing visions of you, a lily among thorns,
Everything looks a little far away to me.
Getting harder and harder to recognize the trap,
Too much information about nothing, too much educated rap,
Just like you told me, it's just like you said it would be.
Well, the moon going up like wildfire, I feel the breath of the storm,
There's something I got to do tonight, you go inside and stay warm.
Someone got a hold of my heart,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart.

Just got back from a city, city of red skies,
Everybody thinks with their stomach and there's plenty of spies,
Every street is crooked, they just wind around until they disappear.
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
Like an ancient river so wide and so deep,
She said, “Be easy, baby, ain't nothing worth stealing here.”
You're the one I been waiting for, you're the one that I desire,
But you must realize first I'm not another man you can hire.
Someone got a hold of my heart,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart.

I can hear that hot-blooded singer on the bandstand croon
“Poison Love”, “Red Roses for Blue Lady”, and “Memphis in June”
While they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
I've been to Babylon and I got to confess
I can still hear that voice crying in the wilderness,
What look large from a distance close up is never that big.
Never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
Never could learn to look at your face and call it mine.
Someone got a hold of my heart,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
Someone got a hold of my heart,
You, you, you, you, you got a hold of my heart, oh, yeah!
