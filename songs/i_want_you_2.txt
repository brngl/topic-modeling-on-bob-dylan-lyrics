The gypsy undertaker cries, the lonesome organ-grinder sighs,
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.
The cracked bells and washed-out horns blow into my face with scorn,
But it's not that way, I wasn't born to lose you.
I want you,
I want you,
I want you so bad,
Honey, I want you.

The drunken politician leaps upon the street where mothers weep
And the saviors, who are fast asleep, they wait for you.
And I wait for them to interrupt me drinking from this broken cup
And ask me to open up the gate for you.
I want you,
I want you,
I want you so bad,
Honey, I want you.

Well, all my fathers, they've gone down,
True love, they've been without it,
And all their daughters put me down
'Cause I don't think about it.

I return to the Queen of Spades, talk with her chambermaid,
She knows that I'm not afraid to look at her.
She is good to me, there's a-nothing she doesn't see,
She knows where I'd like to be, but it doesn't matter.
I want you,
I want you,
I want you so bad,
Honey, I want you.
