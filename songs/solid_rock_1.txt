Well, I'm hanging on
To a solid rock,
Made before the foundation of the world,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
Won't let go and I can't let go no more.

For me He was chastised, for me He was hated,
For me He was rejected by a world that He created.
Nations are angry, cursed are some,
People are expecting a false peace to come.
Well, I'm hanging on
To a solid rock,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
And I won't let go and I can't let go,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
Won't let go and I can't let go no more.

It's the ways of the flesh to war against the spirit,
Twenty-four hours a day you can feel it and you can hear it,
Using every angle under the sun,
And it never give up till the battle's lost or won.
Well, I'm hanging on
To a solid rock,
Made before the foundation of––of the world,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
Won't let go and I can't let go no more.

Won't let go and I can't let go,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
I won't let go and I can't let go,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
Won't let go and I can't let go,
Won't let go and I can't let go.
