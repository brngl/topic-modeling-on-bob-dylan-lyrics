Well, I had to move fast and I couldn't with you around my neck.
I said I'd send for you and I did – what did you expect?
My hands are sweating and we haven't even started yet.
I'll go along with the charade until I can think my way out.
I know it was all a big joke, whatever it was all about.
Someday maybe I'll remember to forget.
I'm gonna get my coat – I feel the breath of a storm.
There's something I've gotta do tonight – you go inside and stay warm.

Has anybody seen my love?
Has anybody seen my love?
Has anybody seen my love?
I don't know.
Has anybody seen my love?

You want to talk to me, go ahead and talk,
Whatever you got to say to me won't come as any shock.
I must be guilty of something, you just whisper it into my ear.
Madame Butterfly, she lulled me to sleep
In a town without pity where the water runs deep,
She said, “Be easy, baby, there ain't nothing worth stealing in here.”
You're the one I've been looking for, you're the one that's got the key,
But I can't figure out whether I'm too good for you or are you too good for me.

Has anybody seen my love?
Ah, has anybody seen my love?
Has anybody seen my love?
I don't know.
Has anybody seen my love?

Well, they're not showing any lights tonight and there's no moon,
There's just a hot-blooded singer singing “Memphis in June”,
And they're beating the devil out of a guy who's wearing a powder-blue wig.
Later he'll be shot for resisting arrest,
I can still hear his voice crying in the wilderness,
What looks large from a distance close up ain't never that big.
I never could learn to drink that blood and call it wine,
I never could learn to hold you, love, and call you mine.

Has anybody seen my love?
Has anybody seen my love?
Has anybody seen my love?
I don't know.
Has anybody seen my love?

Baby, baby.
Honey, baby.
Baby, baby.
Honey, baby.
Baby, baby.
Honey, baby.
Baby, baby.
Honey, baby.
Baby, baby.
Honey, baby.
Baby, baby.
Honey, baby.
Baby, baby...
