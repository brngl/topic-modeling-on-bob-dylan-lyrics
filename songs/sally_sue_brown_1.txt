Look who's back in town,
Ain't nobody but Sally Sue Brown,
All you boys better run for cover
If you don't a-wanna be a brokenhearted lover.

See her in that very tight skirt,
Got what it takes just to make you hurt.
Don't be deceived by those big, bright eyes,
They're full of cheating, misery, low-down lies.

Makes no difference where she's been,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
Breaking a-hearts up and down the line
Like a-she a-broke a-this heart of mine.

I'll go see them come down my way,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
“Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
Please let me love you, baby, don't put me down.”

Makes no difference where she's been,
I know Sal been doing them things again,
Breaking hearts up and down the line
Like a-she a-broke a-this a-heart of mine.

There she come, now, down my way,
Like a fool, you're not gonna hear me say,
“Lay at your bed, Sally Sue Brown,
Please a-let me love you, baby, don't put me down.”
