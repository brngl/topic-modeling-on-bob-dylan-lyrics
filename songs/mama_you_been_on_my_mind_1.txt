Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
And covering the crossroads I'm standing at
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
But, mama, you been on my mind.

I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
I am not pleading or saying “I can't forget you”,
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent, but yet,
Mama, you been on my mind.

Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts, they might be narrow,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow,
I don't mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
Mama, you're just on my mind.

I'm not asking you to say words like “yes” or “no”,
Please understand me, I have no place I'm calling you to go,
I'm just whispering to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
Mama, you are on my mind.

When you wake up in the morning, baby, look inside your mirror,
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near,
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
As someone who has had you on his mind.
