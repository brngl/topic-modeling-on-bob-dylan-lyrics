A-lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
And I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.

I got a heavy-headed gal, I got a heavy-headed gal,
I got a heavy-headed gal, she ain't a-feeling well,
When she's better only time'll tell.
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
And I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.

My money comes and goes, my money comes and goes,
My money comes and goes and rolls and throws and rolls and flows
Through the holes in the pockets in my clothes.
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.

I see the morning light, I see the morning light,
Well, it's not because I'm an early riser,
I didn't go to sleep last night.
Lord, I'm walking down the line, walking down the line,
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be flying – to tell about my troubled mind.

I got my walking shoes, I got my walking shoes,
I got my walking shoes and I ain't a-gonna lose,
What else can a poor boy do?
Lord, I'm walking down the line, lord, I'm walking down the line,
Lord, I'm walking down the line – my feet'll be a-flying – to tell about my troubled mind.
