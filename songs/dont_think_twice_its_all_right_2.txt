Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
If'n you don't know by now,
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe,
It don't matter, anyhow.
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn,
Look out your window and I'll be gone,
You're the reason I'm a-traveling on,
But don't think twice, it's alright.

Well, it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe,
The light I never knowed,
And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe,
I'm on the dark side of the road.
Still, I wish there were something you would do or say
To try and make me change a-my mind and stay,
But we never did too much talking anyway,
So don't think twice, it's alright.

Well, it ain't no use in calling out my name, babe,
Like you never did before,
And it ain't no use in a-calling out my name, babe,
I can't hear you anymore.
I'm a-thinking and wondering, walking down the road,
I once loved a woman – a child, I'm told,
I give her my heart, but she wanted my soul,
But don't think twice, it's alright.

So, I'm a-walking down that long, lonesome road, babe,
Where I'm bound I can't tell,
But goodbye's a-too good a word, babe,
So I'll just say, “Fare thee well.”
I ain't saying you treated me unkind,
You coulda done better, but I don't mind,
You just kinda wasted my precious time,
But don't think twice, it's alright.
