I once held her in my arms,
She said she would always stay,
But I musta been mad, never knew what I had,
I threw it all away,
I threw it all away.

Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
And rivers that ran through every day,
But, what'd I do? I let it slip through,
I threw it all away,
I threw it all away.

Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,
Love and only love – it can't be denied.
No matter what you think about it, you won't be able to do without it –
Take a tip from a-one who's tried.
So, if you find someone who gives you all of her love,
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray.
One thing for sure: there ain't no cure
If you throw it all away,
If you throw it all away.
