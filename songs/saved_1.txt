I was blinded by the devil, born already ruined,
Stone-cold dead as I stepped out of the womb,
By His grace I have been touched, by His word I have been healed,
By His hand I've been delivered, by His spirit I've been sealed.
I've been saved by the blood of the lamb,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
Saved,
Saved,
And I'm so glad,
Yes, I'm so glad,
Well, I'm so glad,
So glad,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
Wanna thank You, Lord,
Wanna thank You, Lord.

By His truth I can be upright, by His strength I do endure,
By His power I've been lifted, in His love I am secure
For He bought me with a price, freed me from the pit
Full of emptiness and wrath and the fire that burns in it.
I've been saved – well, alright,
Saved by the blood of the lamb,
Saved,
And I'm so glad – I'm glad,
So glad,
Thank You, Lord,
I just wanna thank You, Lord – well.

Nobody to rescue me, nobody would dare,
I'm going down for the last time, but by His mercy I've been spared,
Not by works, by faith in Him who called,
For so long I've been hindered, for so long I've been stalled.
But I'm saved,
Yes, I've been saved by the blood of the lamb – well,
I'm so glad,
So glad,
Alright, I'm so glad,
I wanna thank You, Lord,
I just wanna thank You, Lord,
Yes, I do wanna thank You, Lord,
Thank You, Lord,
I thank the Lord,
I just wanna thank You, Lord.
