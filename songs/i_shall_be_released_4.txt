They say everything can be replaced,
Yet every distance is not near,
So I remember every face
Of every man who put me here.
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.

They say every man needs protection,
They say every man must fall,
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Some place so high above this wall.
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.

Now yonder stand with me in this lonely crowd
A man who swears he's not to blame.
All day long I hear his voice shouting so loud,
Crying out that he was framed.
I see my light come shining from the west unto the east,
Any day now, any day now, I shall be released.
