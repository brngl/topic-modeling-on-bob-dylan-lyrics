Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from Jim
That he'd always make sure I'd understand
And that is that there's a certain way we all must swim
If we expect to live off of the fat of the land.
Open the door, Richard, I heard it said before,
Open the door, Richard, heard it said before,
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.

Now, there's a certain thing that I learned from my friend, Mouse,
That fellow who never blushes,
And that is that one must always flush out his house
If he don't expect to be housing flushes.
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.

“Take care of all of your memories,” said Mick,
“For you cannot relive them
And remember when you're out there trying to heal the sick
That you must always first forgive them.”
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
Open the door, Richard, I've heard it said before,
But I ain't gonna hear it said no more.
