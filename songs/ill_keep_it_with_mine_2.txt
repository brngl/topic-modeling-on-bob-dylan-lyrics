Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
But, if I can save you any time,
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.

Well, our train leaves at a-half past ten,
But it will be back here tomorrow the same old time again.
The conductor, he's weary, he's still stuck on the line,
But, if I can save you any time,
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.

I can't help it if you might think that it's odd
If I say I'm loving you not for you'reâ€“what you are but what you're not.
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
But, if I will save you the time,
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.
