Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
Way up yonder, great will be her reward,
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,
I know I can trust you to stay the way you are.
Yes, and I just gotta tell you that I do intend
To stay closer than any friend,
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
And to you always so grateful I will forever be.

I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup,
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up,
And I know that He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,
He must have loved me oh! so much to send me someone as fine as you.
Yes, and I just gotta tell you I do intend
To stay closer––closer than any friend,
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
And to you always so grateful I will forever be.

Covenant woman, intimate, little girl,
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world,
You know that we are strangers in a land we passing through,
I'll always be right by your side, I've got a covenant, too.
Yes, and I just got to tell you that I do intend
To stay closer than any friend,
Yes, and I just got to thank you once again
For making your prayers known unto heaven for me
And to you always so grateful I will forever be.
