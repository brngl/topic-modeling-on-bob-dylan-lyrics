You will search, babe, at any cost,
But how long, babe, can you search for what is not lost?
Everybody will help you, some people are very kind,
But, if I can save you any time,
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.

I can't help it if you might think I am odd
If I say I'm loving you not for what you are but what you're not.
Everybody will help you discover what you set out to find,
But, if I can save you any time,
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.

The train leaves at half past ten,
But it will be back in the same old spot again,
The conductor, he's still stuck on the line.
And, if I can save you any time,
Come on, give it to me, I'll keep it with mine.
