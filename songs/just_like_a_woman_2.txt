A-nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain,
Everybody knows baby's got new clothes,
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows
Have a-fallen from her curls.
A-she takes just like a woman
And she aches just like a woman
And she wakes a-just like a woman,
Yeah, but she breaks a-just like a little girl.

Queen Mary, she's my friend, yes, I believe I'll go see her again,
A-nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Till she sees finally that she's a-like all the rest
In her fog, with her amphetamine and her pearls.
A-she takes just like a woman
And she wakes just like a woman
And she aches just like a woman,
But she breaks a-just like a little girl.

It was raining from the first and I was dying there of thirst, so I came in here
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this a-pain in here,
I can't stay in here â€“ ain't it clear
That I a-just don't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
Then, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Please don't let on a-that you knew me when
I was a-hungry and it was your world.
You take just like a woman
And you ache a-just like a woman
And you make love just like a woman,
But you break just like a little girl.
