I ain't looking to compete with you,
Beat or cheat or mistreat you,
Simplify you, classify you,
Deny, defy, or crucify you.
All I really wanna do
Is, baby, be friends with you.

No, and I ain't looking to fight with you,
Frighten you or up-tighten you,
Drag you down or drain you down,
Chain you down or bring you down.
All I really wanna do
Is, baby, be friends with you.

I ain't looking to block you up,
Shock or knock or lock you up,
Analyze you, categorize you,
Finalize you or advertise you.
All I really wanna do
Is, baby, be friends with you.

I don't wanna straight-face you,
Race or chase you, track or trace you,
Or disgrace you or displace you,
Or define you or confine you.
All I really wanna do
Is, baby, be friends with you.

I don't wanna meet your kin,
Make you spin or do you in,
Or select you or dissect you,
Or inspect you or reject you.
All I really wanna do
Is, baby, be friends with you.

I don't wanna fake you out,
Take or shake or forsake you out,
I ain't looking for you to feel like me,
See like me or be like me.
All I really wanna do
Is, baby, be friends with you.
