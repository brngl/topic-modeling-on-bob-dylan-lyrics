Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
I'm sad and lonely too.
Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
I'm falling in love with you.

Just like you I'm wondering what I'm doing a-here,
Just like you I'm wondering what's going on.

Wallflower, wallflower, won't you dance with me?
The night will soon be gone.

I have seen you standing in the smoky haze
And I know that you're gon' be mine one of these days,
Mine alone.

Wallflower, wallflower, take a chance on me,
Please let me ride you home.
