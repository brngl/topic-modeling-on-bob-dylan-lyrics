The seasons, they are turning and my sad heart is yearning
To hear again the songbird's sweet, melodious tone.
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?

The dusky light the day is losing, orchids, poppies, black-eyed Susan,
The earth and sky that melts with flesh and bone.
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?

The air is thick and heavy all along the levee
Where the geese into the countryside have flown.
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?

Well, I'm preaching peace and harmony, the blessings of tranquility,
Yet I know when the time is right to strike.
I'll take you 'cross the river, dear, you've no need to linger here,
I know the kinds of things you like.

The clouds are turning crimson, the leaves fall from the limbs, and
The branches cast their shadows over stone.
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?

The boulevards of cypress trees, the masquerade of birds and bees,
The petals pink and white the wind has blown.
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?

The trailing moss and mystic glow, the purple blossoms soft as snow,
My tears keep flowing to the sea.
Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief, it takes a thief to catch a thief.
For whom does the bell toll for, love? It tolls for you and me.

My pulse is running through my palm, the sharp hills are rising from
Yellow fields with twisted oaks that groan.
Won't you meet me out in the moonlight alone?
