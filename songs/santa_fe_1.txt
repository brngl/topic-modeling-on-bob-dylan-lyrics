Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
My woman needs it every day,
She promised this a-lad she'd stay,
She rolling up a lots of bread to toss away.
She's in Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Now she's opened up a lefty home,
She's proud, but she needs to roam,
She's opened up a happy home,
She ...
And the Santa Fe.

Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
Since I'm'a never cease to roam,
I'm never, never far from home,
I'm'a ever, ever, ever long to sail away.
Please don't feel bad, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't feel bad,
She's the worst you could ever have,
Since the madman, a-he's so glad,
She's over 'bove the ... pad,
She's never, never feeled so bad I went away.

Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe,
My own heart's in the ...,
I won't have my nature way,
And I'm leaving every day to run away
From Santa Fe, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear Santa Fe.
My woman's never sitting at home,
She's packing up a lease unknown,
She's crying like an evil stone,
She leave by the other and roam,
But she ain't gonna find the road
And that's gonna set her on her own every day.
