Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?

Are you ready to meet Jesus? Are you where you oughtta be?
Will He know you when He sees you or will He say, “Depart from Me”?
Are you ready?
Hope you're ready.
Am I ready?
Am I ready?
Am I ready?
Am I ready?

Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren and to take up my cross?
Have I surrendered to the will of God or am I still acting like the boss?
Am I ready?
I hope I'm ready.

When destruction cometh swiftly and there's no time to say a fare-thee-well,
Have you decided whether you wanna be in heaven or in hell?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?

Have you got some unfinished business? Is there something holding you back?
Are you thinking for yourself or are you following the pack?
Are you ready?
Hope you're ready.
Are you ready?

Are you ready for the judgment? Are you ready for that terrible, swift sword?
Are you ready for Armageddon? Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Are you ready?
I hope you're ready.
