I pulled out for San Anton', I never felt so good,
My woman said she'd meet me there and of course I knew she would.
The coachman, he hit me for my hook and––and he asked me my name,
I'll give it to him right away, then I hung my head in shame.
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Looking for my lo and behold!
Get me outta here, my dear man!

I come into Pittsburgh at six-thirty flat,
I found myself a vacant seat and I put down my hat.
“What's the matter, Molly dear? What's the matter with your mound?”
“What's it to you, Moby Dick? This is chicken-town!”
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Looking for my lo and behold!
Get me outta here, my dear man!

I bought myself a herd of moose, one day she could call it her own,
Well, she came out the very next day to see where they had flown.
I'm going down to Tennessee, get me a truck or something,
Wanna save my money and rip it up.
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Looking for my lo and behold!
Get me outta here, my dear man!

Now, I come in on a Ferris wheel and, boys, I sure was slick,
I come in like a ton of bricks, laid a few tricks on 'em.
Going back to Pittsburgh, count up to thirty,
Round that horn and ride that herd, gonna thread up.
Lo and behold! Lo and behold!
Looking for my lo and behold!
Get me outta here, my dear man!
