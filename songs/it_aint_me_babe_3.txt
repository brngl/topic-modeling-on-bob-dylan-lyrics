Go away from my window,
Leave at your own chosen speed.
I'm not the one you want, babe.
I'm not the one you need.
You say you're looking for someone
Never weak, but always strong,
To protect you and defend you
Whether you are right or wrong,
Someone to open each and every door.
But, it ain't me, babe,
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.

Step lightly from the ledge, babe,
Step lightly on the ground.
I'm not the one you want, babe,
I would only let you down.
You say you're looking for someone
Who will promise never to part,
Someone to close his eyes for you,
Someone to close his heart,
Someone who will die for you and more.
But, it ain't me, babe,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.

Go melt back into the night, babe,
Everything inside is made of stone.
There's nothing in here moving
And, anyway, I'm not alone.
You say you're looking for someone
Pick you up every time you fall,
Someone to get you flowers constantly
And to come every time you call,
A lover for your life, but nothing more.
And it ain't me, babe,
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe,
It ain't me you're looking for, babe.
