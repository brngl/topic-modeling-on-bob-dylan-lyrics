Well, I told my baby, I said, “Baby, I know where you been,
I know who you are and what league you play in.”
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn.

Well, the night is so empty, so quiet and still,
For only fifteen hundred dollars you can have anybody killed.
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn,
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn.

Well, I told my baby further down the line,
I said, “What happens tomorrow is on your head, not mine.”
You wanna ramble, yeah, to the break of dawn,
You wanna ramble, uh, to the break of dawn,
You wanna ramble to the break of dawn.
