Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
Tell 'em Tiny Montgomery says hello.

Now, every boy and girl's gonna get their bang
'Cause Tiny Montgomery's gonna shake that thing.
Tell 'em––everybody down in old Frisco
That Tiny Montgomery's coming down to say hello.

Skinny Moo and T-Bone Frank,
They're all gonna take on down by the bounded bank.
One bird-book and a buzzard and a crow,
Tell 'em all that Tiny's gonna say hello.

Scratch your dad, do that bird,
Suck that pig and bring it on home.
Pink that dream and nose that dough,
Tell 'em all that Tiny says hello.

Now, he's a king of the drunk and he squeezes, too,
Watch out, Lester, take it, Blue,
Join the monk, C.I.O.,
Tell 'em all that Tiny Montgomery says hello.

Now, grease that gig and play it blank,
Hang on and go on out and gas that dog,
Trick on in, flower that smoll,
Take it on down to give me grow.
Now, play that low and pick it up,
Take it on in in a bowl-cup.
Three-legged man and a hot-lipped hoe,
Tell 'em all Montgomery says hello.

Well, you can tell everybody down in old Frisco,
Tell 'em all that Montgomery says hello.
