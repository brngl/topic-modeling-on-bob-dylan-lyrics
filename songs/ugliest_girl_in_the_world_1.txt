Well, the woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
She speaks a-with a stutter and she walks with a hop,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.

If I ever lose her, I will go insane,
I go half-crazy when she calls my name,
She say, “Baby, baby, baby, baby, I lo–lo–love you”,
There ain't nothing in the world that I wouldn't do.
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.

Woman that I love, she got two flat feet,
Her knees knock together walking down the street,
She cracks her knuckles and she snores in bed,
She ain't much to look at, but, like I said,
I love her, yeah, I love her,
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.

I don't mean to say that she got nothing going,
She got a weird sense of humor that's all her own.
When I get low, she sets me on my feet,
Got a five-inch smile, but her breath is sweet.
You know, I love her, yeah, I love her,
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world, hey!

Woman that I love, she got a hook in her nose,
Her eyebrows meet, she wears second-hand clothes,
She speaks with a stutter and she walk with a hop,
I don't know why I love her, but I just can't stop,
I know I love her, yeah, I love her,
I'm in love with the ugliest girl in the world.
