I've been around this whole country,
But I never yet found Fennario.

Well, as we marched down, as we marched down,
Well, as we marched down to Fennario,
Well, our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove.
Her name that she had was Pretty Peggy-O.

Well, what will your mother say, what will your mother say,
What will your mother say, Pretty Peggy-O?
What will your mother say to know you're going away,
You're never, never, never coming back-i-O?

Come running down your stairs, come running down your stairs,
Come running down your stairs, Pretty Peggy-O!
Come running down your stairs, combing back your yellow hair,
You're the prettiest darned girl I ever seen-i-O!

The lieutenant, he has gone, the lieutenant, he has gone,
The lieutenant, he has gone, Pretty Peggy-O!
The lieutenant, he has gone, long gone.
He's riding down in Texas with the rodeo.

Well, the captain, he is dead, our captain, he is dead,
Our captain, he is dead, Pretty Peggy-O!
Well, our captain, he is dead â€“ died for a maid.
He's buried somewheres in Louisiana-O.
