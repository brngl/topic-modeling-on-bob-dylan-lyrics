You're gon' quit me, baby,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
Good as I been to you, Lord, Lord,
Good as I been to you.

Give you my money, honey,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
Buy you shoes and clothes, Lord, Lord,
Buy you shoes and clothes.

You're gon' quit me, baby,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
Put me outta doors, Lord, Lord,
Put me outta doors.

Six months on the chain gang,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
Believe me, it ain't no fun, Lord, Lord,
Believe me, it ain't no fun.

Day you quit me, baby,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
That's the day you die.

Jailhouse ain't no plaything,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
Believe me, ain't no lie, Lord, Lord,
Believe me, ain't no lie.

The day you quit me, baby,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
That's the day you die, Lord, Lord,
That's the day you die.
