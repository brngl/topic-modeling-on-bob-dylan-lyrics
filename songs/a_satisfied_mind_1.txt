How many times have you heard someone say,
“If I had his money, I'd do things my way”?
Hmm, but little they know, hmm, it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind.

Once I was wading in fortune and fame,
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in life's game.
Hmm, suddenly, it happened, hmm, I lost every dime,
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.

When my life is over and my time has run out,
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave, there's no doubt,
But one thing for certain: when it come my time,
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
