Now you're here beside me, baby, you're a living dream,
And, every time you get this close, it makes me want to scream.
You touched me and you knew that I was warm for you and, then,
I ain't never gonna be the same again.

Sorry if I hurt you, baby, sorry if I did,
Sorry if I touched the place where your secrets are hid,
But you meant more than everything and I could not pretend
I ain't never gonna be the same again.

You give me something to think about, baby, every time I see you.
Don't worry, baby, I don't mind leaving, I'd just like it to be my idea.

You taught me how to love you, baby, and you taught me oh so well,
Now I can't go back to what was, baby, I can't unring the bell.
You took my reality and cast it to the wind
And I ain't never gonna be the same again.

Come on, baby.
Come on, darling.
You're too hot, darling.
Come on, baby.
Come on, honey.
You're my baby.
You're my honey.
You got it, baby.
Come on, baby...
