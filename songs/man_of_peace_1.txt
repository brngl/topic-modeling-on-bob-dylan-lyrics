Look out your window, baby, there's a scene you'd like to catch.
Band is playing "Dixie", man got his hand outstretched --
Could be the FÃ¼hrer, could be the local priest.
Know that sometimes Satan, you know, he come as a man of peace.

He got sweet gift of gab, he got harmonious tongue,
Know every song of love that-a ever has been sung.
Good intentions can be evil, both hands can be full of grease.
Know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.

Well, first he's in the background and then he's in the front,
Both eyes are looking like they on a rabbit hunt.
Nobody can see through him, no, not even the Chief of Police.
You know that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.

Well, he catch you when you're hoping for a glimpse of the sun,
Catch you when your troubles feel like they weigh a ton.
He could be standing next to you, the person that you notice least.
I hear that sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.

Well, he can be fascinating, he can be dull,
He can ride down Niagara Falls in the barrels of your skull.
I can smell something cooking, I can tell there's going to be a feast.
You know-a sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.

He's a great humanitarian, he's a great philanthropist,
He knows just where to touch you, honey, and how you like to be kissed.
He'll put both his arms around you, you can feel the tender touch of the beast.
You know sometimes Satan'll come as a man of peace.

Well, howling wolf will howl tonight, a king snake will crawl,
Trees that've stood for a thousand years suddenly will fall.
Wanna get married? Do it now! Tomorrow all activity will cease.
You know-a sometimes Satan come as a man of peace.

Somewhere Mama's weeping for her blue-eyed boy,
She's holding them little, white shoes and that little, broken toy,
And he's following a star, the same one them three men followed from the East.
I hear sometimes Satan come as a man of peace, oh, yeah!
