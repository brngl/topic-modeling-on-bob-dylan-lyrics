The air is getting hotter,
There's a rumbling in the skies,
I've been wading through the high, muddy water
With the heat rising in my eyes.
Every day your memory grows dimmer,
It doesn't haunt me like it did before.
I've been walking through the middle of nowhere,
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.

When I was in Missouri,
They would not let me be.
I had to leave there in a hurry,
I only saw what they let me see.
You broke a heart that loved you,
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore.
I've been walking that lonesome valley,
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.

People on the platforms
Waiting for the trains,
I can hear their hearts a-beating
Like pendulums swinging on chains.
When you think that you've lost everything,
You find out you can always lose a little more.
I'm just going down the road feeling bad,
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door.

I'm going down the river,
Down to New Orleans.
They tell me everything is gonna be alright,
But I don't know what “alright” even means.
I was riding in a buggy with Ms. Mary-Jane –
Ms. Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore.
I've been all around the world, boys,
Now I'm trying to get to heaven before they close the door.

Gonna sleep down in the parlor
And relive my dreams.
I close my eyes and I wonder
If everything is as hollow as it seems.
Some trains don't pull no gamblers,
No midnight ramblers like they did before.
I've been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down,
Now I'm trying to get to heaven before they close the door.
