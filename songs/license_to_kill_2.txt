Man thinks, 'cause he rules the earth, he can do with it as he please
And, if things don't change soon, he will.
Oh, man has invented his doom, first step was touching the moon.
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
She say, “Who take away his license to kill?”

Well, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
And they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill.
Then they bury him in stars, sell his body like they do used cars.
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
She say, “Who take away his license to kill?”

Well, he's hell-bent for destruction, he's afraid and confused
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill.
All he believes are his eyes and his eyes, they just tell him lies.
Well, there's a woman on my block, she just sit there facing the hill,
She'll say, “Who take away his license to kill?”

May be noisemaker, spirit-maker,
Heartbreaker, backbreaker,
Leave no stone unturned.
May be an actor in a plot,
That might be all that you got
Till your error you clearly learn.

Well, he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
And, when he sees his reflection, he's fulfilled.
Man is opposed to fair play:
He wants it all and he wants it his way.
Well, there's a woman on my block, she'll just sit there facing the hill,
She say, “Who take away his license to kill?”

Thank you.
