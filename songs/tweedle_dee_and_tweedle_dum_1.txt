Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee,
They're throwing knives into the tree,
Two big bags of dead man's bones,
Got their noses to the grindstones.

Living in the land of Nod,
Trusting their fate to the hands of God,
They pass by so silently,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee.

Well, they're going to the country, they're gonna retire,
They're taking a streetcar named “Desire”,
Looking at the window at the pecan pie,
Lotta things they'd like they would never buy.

Neither one gonna turn and run,
They're making a voyage to the sun.
“His Master's voice is calling me,”
Said Tweedle Dum to Tweedle Dee.

Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,
All that and more and then some,
They walk among the stately trees,
They know the secrets of the breeze.

Tweedle Dum said to Tweedle Dee,
“Your presence is obnoxious to me.”
They're like babies sitting on a woman's knee,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee.

Well, the rain beating down on my windowpane,
I got love for you and it's all in vain.
Brains in the pot, they're beginning to boil,
They're dripping with garlic and olive oil.

Tweedle Dee's on his hands and his knees,
Saying, “Throw me something, mister, please.”
“What's good for you is good for me,”
Said Tweedle Dum to Tweedle Dee.

Well, they're living in a happy harmony,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee.
They're one day older and a dollar short,
They got a parade permit and a police escort.

They're lying low and they're making hay,
They seem determined to go all the way.
They run a brick and tile company,
Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee.

Well, a childish dream is a deathless need
And a noble truth is a sacred creed.
My pretty baby, she's looking around,
She's wearing a multi-thousand dollar gown.

Tweedle Dee, he's a low-down, sorry, old man,
Tweedle Dum, he'll stab you where you stand.
“I've had too much of your company,”
Said Tweedle Dum to Tweedle Dee.
