'Twas in the summer one early fall,
Just trying to find my little all and all.
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.

'Twas in the spring one summer's day,
Just when she left me, she gon' to stay.
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.

Now, don't come running holding up your hand,
Can get me a woman quick as you can get a man.
Now she's gone and I don't worry,
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.

Happen for days, didn't know your name.
Why should I worry or crave you in vain?
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.

Went to the station down in the yard,
Gon' get me a freight train, the work done got hard.
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.

The lonesome days, they have gone by.
Why should I beg you? You said good-bye.
Now she's gone, I don't worry,
Lord, I'm sitting on top of the world.
