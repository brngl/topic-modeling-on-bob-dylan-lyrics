Time passes slowly up here in the mountains,
We set beside bridges and walk beside fountains,
Catch the wild fishes that float through the stream –
Time passes slowly when you're lost in a dream.

Once I had a sweetheart, she was fine and good-looking,
We sat in her kitchen while her mama was cooking,
Staring out the window to the stars high above –
Time passes slow when you're searching for love.

Ain't no reason to go in a wagon to town,
Ain't no reason to go to the fair,
Ain't no reason to go up, ain't no reason to go down,
Ain't no reason to go anywhere.

Time passes slowly up here in the daylight,
Stares straight ahead and tries so hard to stay right,
Like the red rose of summer that blooms in the day
Time passes slowly and fades away.
