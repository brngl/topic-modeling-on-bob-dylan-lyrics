I paid fifteen million dollars, twelve hundred and seventy-two cents,
I paid one thousand two hundred twenty-seven dollars and fifty-five cents,
See my bulldog bite a rabbit and my hound dog is sitting on a barbed-wire fence,
Alright!

Well, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot,
Yes, my temperature rises and my feet can't walk so hot.
Well, this Arabian doctor comes in, gives me a shot,
But wouldn't tell me what it was that I got.

Well, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive,
Yes, this woman I've got, she's killing me alive.
She's making me into an old man and, man, I'm not even twenty-five!

Of course, you're gonna think this song is a riff,
I know you're gonna think this song is just a riff
Unless you been inside a tunnel and fell down sixty-nine, seventy feet over a barbed-wire fence,
Alright!
