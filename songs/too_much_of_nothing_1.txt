Too much of nothing can make a man ill at ease:
One man's temper rises, well, another man's temper might freeze.
Now, it's that day of confession and we cannot mock a soul,
Oh, when there's too much of nothing, no one has control.

Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
Give her all my salary on the waters of oblivion.

Well, there's too much of nothing––can cause a man to weep,
He can walk the streets like most and boast of what he'd like to keep,
But it's all been done before, it's all been written in the book
And, when there's too much of nothing, nobody should look.

Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
Give her all my salary on the waters of oblivion.

Now, too much of nothing can make a man a liar,
It can cause some men to sleep on nails, it can cause others to eat fire.
Everybody's doing something – I've heard it in a dream,
But, when there's too much of nothing, it just makes a fellow mean.

Say hello to Valerie, say hello to Vivian,
Give her all my salary on the waters of oblivion.
