Nobody feels any pain tonight as I stand inside the rain.
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes,
But lately I see her ribbons and her bows have fallen from her curls.
She takes just like a woman – yes, she does!
She makes love just like a woman – yes, she does!
And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.

Queen Mary, she's my friend. Yes, I believe I'll go see her again.
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed
Till she finally sees that she's like all the rest with her fog, her amphetamine, and her pearls.
She takes just like a woman – yes!
She makes love just like a woman – yes, she does!
And she aches just like a woman, but she breaks just like a little girl.

It was raining from the first and I was dying of thirst so I came in here.
And your long-time curse hurts, but what's worse is this pain in here.
I can't stay in here – ain't it clear
That I just can't fit? Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit.
And, when we meet again, introduced as friends,
Please don't let on that you knew me when I was hungry and it was your world.
Ah, you fake just like a woman – yes, you do!
You make love just like a woman – yes, you do!
Then you ache just like a woman, but you break just like a little girl.
