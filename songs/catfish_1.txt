Lazy stadium night, catfish on the mound,
“Strike three,” the umpire said, batter has to go back and sit down.
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.

Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm, but the old man wouldn't pay,
So he packed his glove and took his arm and one day he just ran away.
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.

Come up where the Yankees are, dress up in a pinstripe suit,
Smoke a custom-made cigar, wear an alligator boot.
Catfish, million-dollar-man,
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.
