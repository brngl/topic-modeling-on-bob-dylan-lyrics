Mary wore three links of chain.
Every link was Jesus's name.
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!

Mary, Mark, and Luke, and John,
All them prophets good and gone,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!

Well, I never been to heaven, but I've been told
Streets up there're lined with gold.
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord,
Keep-a your hand on that plow, hold on!
