The man in me will do nearly any task
And as for compensation there's a-little he would ask –
Take a woman like you to get through to the man in me.

Storm clouds are raging all around my door,
I think to myself I might not take it anymore –
Take a woman like your kind to find the man in me.

But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Just to know that you are near,
It sets my a-heart a-reeling
From my toes up to my ears.

The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from being seen,
But that's just because he doesn't wanna turn into some machine –
Take a woman like you to get through to the man in me.
