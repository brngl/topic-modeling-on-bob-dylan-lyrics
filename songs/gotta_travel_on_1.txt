Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
And it seems like I've gotta travel on,
And it seems like I've a-gotta travel on.

Papa writes to Johnny – Johnny can't come home,
Johnny can't come home, Johnny can't come home.
Papa writes to Johnny – johnny can't come home,
Johnny's been out on the road too long.
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
And it seems like I've gotta travel on.

That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way,
Going home to stay, going home to stay,
That chilly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
And I feel like I just a-wanna travel on.
So, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on,
Oh, yes, I've done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
And it seems like I want to travel on.

There's a lonesome freight at six o' eight a-coming through the town:
I'll be homeward bound, I'll be homeward bound.
A lonesome freight at six o' eight coming on through the town
And I feel like I just a-want to travel on.
Well, I done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long,
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on, yes, it is,
Done laid around, done stayed around this old town too long
And it seems like I want to travel on.
