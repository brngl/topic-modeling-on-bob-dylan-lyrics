Now and then there's a fool such as I.
Pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Don't be angry––don't be angry with me should I cry.
When you're gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.

Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you,
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through.
I'm a fool, but I love you, dear, yes, I will until the day I die,
Now and then there's a fool such as I.

Pardon me––pardon me if I'm sentimental when we say goodbye,
Don't be angry––don't be angry with me should I cry.
When you're gone––when you're gone, I will dream a little, I will dream as years go by,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I.

Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I am over you,
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through.
I'm a fool, yes, but I love you, dear, I'll love you, dear, until the day––until the day I die,
Now and then––now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
Now and then there's a fool––a fool such as I,
Now and then there's a fool such as I.
