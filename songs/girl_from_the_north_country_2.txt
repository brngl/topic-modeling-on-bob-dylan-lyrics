If you're traveling to the north country fair,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
Remember me to one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine.

See for me that her hair's hanging down,
It curls and falls all down her breast.
See for me that her hair's hanging down.
That's the way I remember her best.

If you go when the snowflakes fall,
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,
Please see for me if she's wearing her coat so warm,
To keep her from the howling winds.

If you're traveling in the north country fair,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
Remember me to one who lives there
For she once was a true love of mine.

If you're traveling in the north country fair,
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,
Remember me to one who lives there.
She once was a true love of mine,
A true love of mine,
True love of mine,
A true love of mine.
