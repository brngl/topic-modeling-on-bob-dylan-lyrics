I didn't know that you'd be leaving â€“
Who you thought you were talking to?
I figure maybe we're even
Or maybe I'm one up on you.
I send you all my money
Just like I did before,
I tried to reach you, honey,
But you're drifting too far from shore,
Drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Drifting too far from shore.

I ain't a-gonna get lost in this current,
I don't like playing cat-and-mouse.
No gentleman likes making love to a servant,
'Specially when he's in his father's house.
I never could guess your weight, baby,
Never needed to call you my whore,
I always thought you were straight, baby,
But you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Drifting too far from shore,
Drifting too far from shore,
Drifting too far from shore.

Well, these times and these tunnels are haunted,
The bottom of the barrel is too.
I've waited years sometimes for what I've wanted,
Everybody can't be as lucky as you.
Never no more do I wonder
Why you don't never play with me anymore:
At any moment you could go under
'Cause you're drifting too far from shore, yeah,
Drifting too far from shore,
Drifting too far from shore,
Drifting too far from shore.

You and me, we had completeness,
I gave you all of what I could provide.
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,
We were the wrong side.
I've already ripped out the phones, honey,
You can't walk the streets in a war.
I can finish this alone, honey,
You're drifting too far from shore.
