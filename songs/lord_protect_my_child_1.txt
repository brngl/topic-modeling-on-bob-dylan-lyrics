For his age he is wise,
He's got his mother's eyes.
There's gladness in his heart, he's young and he's wild.
My only prayer is if I can't be there,
Lord, protect my child.

As his youth now unfolds,
He is centuries old,
See him at play makes me smile.
No matter what happens to me, no matter what my destiny,
Lord, protect my child.

Well, the whole earth is asleep,
You could look at it and weep,
Few things you find are worthwhile.
And, though I don't ask for much, no material things to touch,
Lord, protect my child.

He's young and on fire,
Full of hope and desire
In a world that's been raped, raped and defiled.
If I fall along the way and can't see another day,
A-lord, protect my child.

There'll be a time, I hear tell,
When all will be well,
When God and man will be reconciled,
But, until men lose their chains and righteousness reigns,
Lord, protect my child.
