The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
I wish to my soul that I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.

Don't you remember me, babe?  I remember you quite well,
You caused me to leave old Kingsport Town with a high sheriff on my trail.

High sheriff on my trail, boys, high sheriff on my trail,
All because I'm falling for a curly-headed, dark-eyed gal.

Who's a-gonna stroke your cold, black hair and sandy-colored skin?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis lips when I'm out in the wind,
When I'm out in the wind, babe, when I'm out in the wind?
Who's a-gonna kiss your Memphis mouth when I'm out in the wind?

Who's a-gonna walk you side by side and tell you everything's alright?
Who's a-gonna sing to you all day long and not just in the night?
Who's a-gonna walk you side by side? Who's a-gonna be your man?
Who's a-gonna look you straight in the eye and hold your bad-luck hand?

Hold your bad-luck hand, babe, hold your bad-luck hand,
Who's a-gonna hold your hard-luck hand and who's a-gonna be your man?

The winter wind is a-blowing strong, my hands a-got no gloves,
I wish to my soul I could see the gal I'm a-thinking of.
