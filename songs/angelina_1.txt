Well, it's always been my nature to take chances,
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances,
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances to the tune of a concertina.
Blood drying in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore,
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door,
But whatever could it be makes you think you've seen me before, Angelina?
Oh, Angelina,
Oh, Angelina.

His eyes were two slits â€“ make any snake proud,
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
Worshiping a god with the body of a woman well-endowed and the head of a hyena.
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek, Angelina,
Oh, Angelina,
Oh, Angelina.

In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode,
The peaches, they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed.
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road with your subpoena.
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame?
I've tried my best to love you, but I cannot play this game,
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same, Angelina,
Oh, Angelina,
Oh, Angelina.

There's a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone,
Your servants are half-dead, you're down to the bone.
Tell me, tall man, where would you like to be overthrown, in Jerusalem or Argentina?
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old,
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold.
He's surrounded by God's angels and she's wearing a blindfold, but so are you, Angelina,
Oh, Angelina,
Oh, Angelina.

I see pieces of men marching, trying to take heaven by force,
I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse.
In God's truth, babe, tell me what you want and you'll have it of course, just step into the arena.
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases,
Past the tree of smoke, past the angel with four faces,
Begging God for mercy, weeping in unholy places, Angelina,
Oh, Angelina,
Oh, Angelina,
Oh, Angelina.
