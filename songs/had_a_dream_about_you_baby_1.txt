I got to see you, baby, I don't care,
It may be some place, baby, you say where.
I had a dream about you, baby,
Dream about you, baby,
Late last night you come rolling across my mind.

You got the crazy rhythm when you walk,
You make me nervous when you start to talk.
I had a dream about you, baby,
A dream about you, baby,
Late last night you come rolling across my mind.

I stand on highway, baby flag me down,
Said, “Take me, daddy, to the nearest town.”
I had a dream about you, baby,
Had a dream about you, baby,
Late last night you come rolling across my mind.

The joint is jumping,
It's really something,
The beat is pumping,
Well, I'm just thumping.
Spent my money on you, honey,
My limbs are shaking,
My mind is breaking.

You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop,
You make me so mad I tell you to stop.
I had a dream about you, baby,
Dream about you, baby,
Late last night you come rolling across my mind.

The joint is jumping,
It's really something,
The beat is pumping,
Well, I'm just thumping.
Spent my money on you, honey,
My limbs are shaking,
My mind is breaking.

You wear a blue scarf upon your head,
Wear a long dress fire-engine red.
I had a dream about you, baby,
Dream about you, baby,
Late last night you come rolling across my mind.
