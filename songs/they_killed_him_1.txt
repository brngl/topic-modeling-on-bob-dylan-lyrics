There was a man named Mahatma Gandhi,
Wouldn't bow down, he would not fight.
He knew the deal was a-down and dirty,
Nothing wrong could make it right away,
But he knew his duty and the price he had to pay,
Just another holy man who dared to be a friend.

My God, they killed Him!

Another man from Atlanta, Georgia,
Name of Martin Luther King,
He shook the land like a rolling thunder,
He made the bells of freedom ring today
With a dream of beauty that they cannot take away,
Just another holy man who dared to make a stand.

My God, they killed Him!

The only son of God Almighty,
The holy one called Jesus Christ,
He healed the sick and He fed the hungry
And for His love they took His life away
On the road to glory where the story never ends,
Just the holy son of man I'll never understand.

My God, they killed Him!
