I can't understand,
She let go of my hand
And left me here facing the wall.
I'd sure like to know
Why she did go,
But I can't get close to her at all.
Though we kissed through the wild, blazing nighttime,
She said she would never forget,
But now morning is clear,
It's like I ain't here,
She acts like we never met.

It's all new to me
Like some mystery,
It could even be like a myth,
But it's hard to think on
That she's the same one
That last night I was with.
From darkness dreams are deserted --
Am I still dreaming yet?
I wish she'd unlock
Her voice once and talk
'Steada acting like we never met.

If she ain't feeling well,
Then why don't she tell
'Steada turning her back to my face?
Without any doubt
She seems too far out
For me to return to or chase.
And her skirt, it swayed as the guitar played,
Her mouth was watery and wet,
But now something has changed
For she ain't the same,
She just acts like we never have met.

If I didn't have to guess,
I'd gladly confess
To anything I mighta tried.
If I was with her too long
Or have done something wrong,
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run and hide.
Though the night ran swirling and whirling,
I remember her whispering yet.
But evidently she don't,
Evidently she won't.
She just acts like we never have met.

I'm leaving today,
I'll be on my way,
Of this I can't say very much,
But, if you want me to,
I can be just like you
And pretend that we never have touched,
And, if anybody asks me,
“Is it easy to forget?”
I'll say, “It's easily done,
You just pick anyone
And pretend that you never have met.”
