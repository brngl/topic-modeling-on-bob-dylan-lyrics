Well, the marriage vow, you know, it's very sacred,
Man put us together, now, you wanna make it stick together,
Come on, come on, stick together,
You know, you made a vow not to leave one another, never.

Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
Come on, come on, stick together,
We made a vow not to leave one another, never.

Well, you never miss your water till your well runs dry,
Come on, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together,
Come on, come on, let's stick together,
You know, we made a vow not to leave one another, never.

It might be tough for a while, but consider the child
Cannot be happy without his mom and his pappy, let's stick together,
Come on, come on, stick together,
You know, we made a vow not to leave one another, never.
