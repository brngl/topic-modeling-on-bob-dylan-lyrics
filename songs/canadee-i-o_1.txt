Well, it's all of a fair and a handsome girl, she's all in her tender years.
She fell in love with a sailor boy, it's true she loved him well
For to go off to sea with him like she did not know how.
She longed to see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o.

So she bargained with the sailor boy all for a piece of gold.
Straightaway then he led her down into the hold,
Saying, “I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes, your jacket shall be blue.
You'll see that seaport town of Canadee-i-o.”

Now, when the other sailors heard the news, well, they fell into a rage
And with all the ship's company they were willing to engage,
Saying, “We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys, overboard, we'll throw her.
She'll never see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o.”

Now, when the captain, he heard the news, well, he too fell in a rage
And with the whole ship's company he was willing to engage,
Saying, “She'll stay all in sailor's clothes, her color shall be blue.
She'll see that seaport town called Canadee-i-o.”

Now, when they came down to Canada scarcely about half a year,
She's married this bold captain, who called her his dear.
She's dressed in silks and satins now, she cuts a gallant shawl,
Finest of the ladies down Canadee-i-o.

Come, all you fair and tender girls, wheresoever you may be,
I'd have you to follow your own, true love whenever he goes to sea
For, if the sailors prove false to you, well, the captain, he might prove true.
You'll see the honor I have gained by the wearing of the blue.
