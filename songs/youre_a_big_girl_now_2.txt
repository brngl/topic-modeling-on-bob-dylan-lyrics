Our conversation was short and sweet,
It nearly knocked me off of my feet –
And I'm back in the rain,
Eh, and you are on dry land,
You made it there somehow,
You're a big girl now.

Bird on the horizon sitting on a fence,
He's singing his song for me at his own expense –
And I'm just like that bird,
Eh, singing just for you,
I a-hope you can hear––
Hear me singing through these tears.

Love is so simple, to quote a phrase,
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days –
Oh, I know where I can find you,
Eh, in somebody's room,
It's a price I'll have to pay,
You're a big girl all the way.

Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast,
Oh, but what a shame! if all we've shared can't last.
Well, I may just swear,
Eh, see what you can do,
I can make it through,
You can make it too.

A change in the weather is always extreme,
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
I'm going out of my mind,
Hey, with a pain that stops and starts,
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Ever since we've been apart.
