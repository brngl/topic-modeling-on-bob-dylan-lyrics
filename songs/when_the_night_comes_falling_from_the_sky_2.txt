You can look out across the fields, see me returning,
Smoke gets in your eyes, you draw the smile
From the fireplace where now my letters to you are burning,
You've had time to think about it for a while.
I've walked two hundred miles, now look me over,
It's the end of the chase and the moon is high,
It don't matter who loves who – either you'll love me or I'll love you –
When the night comes falling from the sky.

I can see through your walls and I know you're hurting,
Sorrow covers you up like a cape,
Only yesterday I know that you've been flirting
With disaster that you somehow managed to escape.
Oh, that I can't provide for you no easy answer.
Who are you that I should have to lie?
You'll know everything I know down below and up above
When the night comes falling from the sky.

I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river 
And recently you've thought you've seen it all,
But you're disappointed now with those who did not deliver,
But it was you who set yourself up for a fall.
I seen thousands who could've overcome the darkness,
For the love of a lousy buck I watched them die.
Stick around, baby, we're not through, don't look for me, I'll see you
When the night comes falling from the sky.

In your teardrops I can see my own reflection,
Luck was with me when I crossed the borderline,
I don't wanna be a fool that's starving for affection,
I don't wanna drown in someone else's wine.
For all eternity I think I will remember
That whirlpool of life that's in your eye,
You will seek me and you'll find me in the wasteland of your mind
When the night comes falling from the sky.

Well, I gave to you my heart, my bed, and treasure
Whose suffering seemed to fit you like a glove,
I'm so tired of those who use you for their own pleasure,
Who think they've got the line up for me on love.
Well, this time I'm asking for freedom,
Freedom from a world which you deny,
And you'll give it to me now or I'll take it anyhow
When the night comes falling from the sky.
