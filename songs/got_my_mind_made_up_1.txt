Don't ever try to change me,
I been in this thing too long.
There's nothing you can say or do
To make me think I'm wrong.
Well, I'm going off to Libya,
There's a guy I gotta see.
He been living there three years now
In an oil refinery.
I got my mind made up,
Oh, got my mind made up.

Oh!

Call your ma in Tallahassee,
Tell her her baby's on the line.
Tell her not to worry,
Everything is gonna be fine.
Well, I gave you all my money,
All my connections too.
There ain't nothing in this world
You can say I didn't give to you.
I got my mind made up, yeah!
Got my mind made up.

You will be alright, girl,
Someone's watching over you.
He won't do nothing to you,
Baby, that I wouldn't do.
Well, if you don't want to see me,
Look a-the other way.
You don't have to feed me,
I ain't your dog that's gone astray.
I got my mind made up,
I got my mind made up,
Got my mind made up,
I got my mind made up,
Got my mind made up.
