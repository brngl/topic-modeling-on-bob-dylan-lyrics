Clouds so swift, the rain falling in, gonna see a movie called “Gunga Din” –
Pack up your money, pull up your tent, McGuinn, you ain't a-going nowhere!
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!

Genghis Khan and his brother, Don, couldn't keep on keeping on:
“We'll climb that bridge after it's dawn, after we're way past it.”
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!

Buy me some rings and a gun that sings, a flute that toots and a bee that stings,
Sky that cries and a bird that flies, a fish that walks and a dog that talks.
Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!

Ooh-ee, ride me high, tomorrow's the day that my bride's a-gonna come!
Ooh-ee, are we gonna fly down into the easy chair!
