Lenny Bruce is dead, but his ghost lives on and on,
Never did get any Golden Globe Award, never made it to Synanon.
He was an outlaw, that's for sure,
More of an outlaw than you ever were.
Lenny Bruce is gone, but his spirit's living on and on.

Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn't work out,
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talking about.
Never robbed any churches, nor cut off any babies' heads;
He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds.
He's on some other shore, he didn't wanna live anymore.

Lenny Bruce is dead, but he didn't commit any crime,
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time.
I rode with him in a taxi once
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months.
Lenny Bruce moved on and yet the ones that killed him are gone.

They said that he was sick 'cause he didn't play by the rules,
He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools.
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts,
He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts.
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had.
