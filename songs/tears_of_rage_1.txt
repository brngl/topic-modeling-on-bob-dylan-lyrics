We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
And now you'd throw us all aside and put us on our way.
Oh, what dear daughter would––'neath the sun––would treat her father so?
To wait upon him hand and foot, yet always answer “no”?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why I'm always the one who must feel a thief?
Come to me now, you know, we're so alone and life is brief.

It was all pointed out, the way to go, and scratched your name in sand,
Though you just thought that it was nothing more than a place for you to stand.
Now, I want you to know that, while you watched––discover that there was no one true,
That I myself really thought it was just a childish thing to do.
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
Come to me now, you know, we're so alone and life is brief.

It was all very, very painless when you ran out to receive
All that false instruction, which we never could believe,
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse,
But, oh, what kind of love is this, which goes from bad to worse?
Tears of rage, tears of grief, why am I always the one who must feel the thief?
Come to me now, you know, we're so alone and life is brief.
