Well, I just reached a place where I can't stay awake,
I got to leave you, baby, before my heart will break,
I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.

Come over here, baby, 'cause I'm telling you this,
You got to believe it, you gotta give me one more kiss,
I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.

Fix me one more drink, baby, and hold me one more time,
But don't get too close to make me change my mind,
I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.

Now, my mama always said, “Someday, true––you gotta follow your heart,
You'll be grand at the end of the line:
All that's gold wasn't meant to shine,
Just don't put your horse in front of your cart,” ohh!

Now, from Boston to Birmingham is a two-day ride,
But I got to be going now 'cause I'm so dissatisfied,
I'm going, I'm going, I'm gone.

Going,
Going, going, gone,
Going, going,
Going, going, gone.
