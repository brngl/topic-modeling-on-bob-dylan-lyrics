Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no driving wheel,
You all been down and lonesome, you know just how a poor man feels.

Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
Been shooting craps and gambling, mama, and I done got broke,
I done pawned my pistol, baby, my best clothes been stoled.

Lordy, Lord!
Lordy, Lordy, Lord!
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
Lordy, Lord!

I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knee,
I ain't crying for no religion, Lord, give me back my good gal please.

If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more,
Don't have to put her in my house, Lordy, just lead her to my door.

Lordy, Lord!
Lordy, Lordy, Lord!
Lordy, Lord!
Lordy, Lordy, Lord!

Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
Can't you hear me, baby, rapping on your door?
Tapping ..., tapping across your floor.

Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all,
What make me love my woman she can really do the Georgia Crawl.

Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,
If you're a real hot mama, come and drive away Daddy's weeping spell.
