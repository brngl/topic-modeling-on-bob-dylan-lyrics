Crash on the levee, mama, water's gonna overflow,
Swamp's gonna rise and no boat's gonna row.
You can train on down to Williams Point,
You can bust your feet, you can rock this joint,
But, oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.

Now, don't you try and move me, mama, you just gonna lose,
There's been a crash on the levee and, mama, you been refused.
Well, it's king for king and it's queen for queen,
It's gonna be the meanest flood that anybody's ever seen,
Oh, mama, you gonna miss your best friend now,
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.

Well, the high tide's rising, mama, don't you let me down,
Pack up your suitcase, mama, don't you make a sound.
Well, it's sugar for sugar and it's salt for salt,
If you go down in the flood, it's gonna be your fault.
Oh, mama, ain't you gonna miss your best friend now?
You gonna have to find yourself another best friend somehow.
