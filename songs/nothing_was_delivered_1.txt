Nothing was delivered
And I tell this truth to you
Not out of spite, nor anger,
But simply because it's true.
Now, I hope you won't object to giving––
Giving back all of what you owe,
The fewer words you have to waste on this,
The sooner you can go.
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
Take care of yourself, get plenty rest.

Nothing was delivered,
But I can't say I sympathize
With what your fate is going to be,
Yes, for telling all those lies.
Now, you must provide some answers
For what you sold that's not been received
And the sooner you come up with them,
The sooner you can leave.
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
Take care of yourself, get plenty rest.

Now, you know, nothing was delivered
And it's up to you to say
Just what you had in mind
When you made everybody pay.
No, nothing was delivered,
Yes, and someone must explain
That, as long as it takes to do this,
Then that's how––as long as you'll remain.
Nothing is better, nothing is best,
Take care of yourself, get plenty rest.
