I got mixed up confusion, man, it's a-killing me,
Well, there's too many people and they're all too hard to please.

Well, my hat's in my hand, babe, I'm walking down the line,
I'm looking for a woman with a head mixed up like mine.

Well, I'm too old to lose, babe, I'm too young to win,
Now I feel like a stranger in a world I'm living in.

But I'm walking and wandering – my poor feet don't ever stop! –
Seeing my reflection, I'm hung over, hung down, hung up!
