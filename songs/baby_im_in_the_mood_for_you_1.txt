Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna milk my milk-cow low,
Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna leave my lonesome home,
Yes, sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna hit that highway road,
But then again–and then again, I said, oh–whoa–whoa–oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.

Sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna turn my back to the wall,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna live in my pony-stall,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I ain't gonna do nothing at all,
But then again, I said, oh–I said, oh–I said, oh–oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.

Woo!

Sometimes I'm in the mood I wanna change my house around,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change things in the town,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna change the whole world around,
But then again–I think again–and then the–whoa–I said, oh–I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.

Sometimes I'm in the mood, I'm gonna give away all my sins,
And sometimes I'm in the mood, I wanna walk the road again,
And sometimes I'm in the mood that I'm bound to lose again,
But then again, I said–again, I said, whoa–whoa, babe, sometimes I'm in the mood for you.

Woo!

I said, whoa–whoa–whoa–whoa, I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you,
I said, oh, babe, I'm in the mood for you.
