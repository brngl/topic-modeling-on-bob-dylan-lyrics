Mama, take this badge off of me,
I can't use it anymore.
It's getting dark, too dark to see,
Feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Just like so many times before.

Mama, wipe the blood outta my eyes,
I can't see through it anymore.
Suddenly I'm like crawled up in my side
And I feel like I'm knocking on a-heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.

Mama, put my guns in the ground,
I can't fight them anymore.
That long, black train is pulling down
And I feel like I'm knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door,
Knock––knock––knocking on heaven's door.
