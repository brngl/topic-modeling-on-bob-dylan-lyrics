You harbor resentment, you know that ain't too much of a thrill,
You wish for contentment, but you got an emptiness that can't be filled,
You had enough of hatred,
Your bones are breaking, can't find nothing sacred.
Ye shall be changed,
Ye shall be changed,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
And ye shall be changed.

Everything you've gotten you've gotten by sweat, blood, and the muscle,
From early in the morning till way past dark, all you ever do is a-hustle,
All your loved ones have walked out of the door,
You're not even sure 'bout your wife and kids no more.
But ye shall be a-changed,
Ye shall be changed,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
And ye shall be changed.

The past don't control you, but the future's like a roulette wheel spinning,
Deep down inside, you know, you know â€“ need a whole new beginning.
Don't have to go to Russia or Iran,
Just surrender to God and He'll move you right here where you stand
And ye shall be a-changed,
Ye shall be a-changed,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
And ye shall be a-changed.

You drink bitter water on your bed, eating your bread of sorrow,
Can't live for today when all you're thinking of-a is tomorrow.
The path you've endured has been rough,
When you've decided that you've had enough,
Ye shall be a-changed,
Ye shall be a-changed,
In a twinkling of an eye when the last trumpet blows,
The dead will arise and burst out of your clothes
And ye shall be changed.
