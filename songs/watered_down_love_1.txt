Love that's pure hopes all things,
Believes all things, won't pull no strings,
Won't sneak up into your room, tall, dark, and handsome,
Capture your soul and hold it for ransom.
You don't want a love that's pure,
You wanna drown love,
You want a watered-down love.

Love that's pure, it don't make no false claims,
Intercedes for you 'stead of casting you blame,
Will not deceive you or lead you into transgression,
Won't write it up and make you sign a false confession.
You don't want a love that's pure,
You wanna drown love,
You want a watered-down love.

Love that's pure won't lead you astray,
Won't hold you back, won't get in your way,
Won't pervert you, corrupt you with foolish wishes,
Will no––not make you envious, won't make you suspicious.
You don't want a love that's pure,
You wanna drown love,
You want a watered-down love.

Love that's pure no accident,
It knows that it knows, is always content,
An eternal flame quietly burning,
Never needs to be proud, loud, or restlessly yearning.
You don't want a love that's pure,
You wanna drown love,
You want a watered-down love.

Watered-down love,
You want watered-down love,
Watered-down love,
You want watered-down love,
Yes, you do, you know you do.
Watered-down love,
Oh, you want watered-down love,
Yes, you do, you know you do.
Watered-down love,
Ooh, watered-down love,
Yes, you do, you know you do.
Watered-down love,
Ooh, you want watered-down love,
Yes, you do, you know you do.
Watered-down love,
Oh, watered-down love,
You want watered-down love,
Yes, you do, you know you do…
