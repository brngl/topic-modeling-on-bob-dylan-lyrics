There's guns across the river aiming at you,
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch you,
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get you –
Billy, they don't like you to be so free.

Camping out all night on the veranda,
Dealing cards till dawn in the hacienda,
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send you –
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.

Playing around with some sweet senorita,
Into her dark hall where she will lead you,
To the shadows of the Mesa she will greet you –
Billy, you're so far away from home.
