Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith,
Nasty, dirty, double-crossing, back-stabbing phony I didn't have to wanna have to deal with,
But I did it for you and all you gave me was a smile.
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn to cry a while.

I don't carry dead weight, I'm no flash in the pan,
Alright, I'll set you straight, can't you see I'm a union man?
I'm letting the cat out of the cage, I'm keeping a low profile.
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.

Feel like a fighting rooster, feel better than I ever felt,
But the Pennsylvania line's in an awful mess and the Denver road is about to melt.
I went to the church house, every day I go an extra mile.
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.

Last night 'cross the alley there was a pounding on the wall,
It must have been Don Pasquale making a 2 AM booty call.
To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style.
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn to cry a while.

I'm on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can't control,
Some people, they ain't human, they got no heart or soul.
Well, I'm crying to the lord, trying to be meek and mild.
Yes, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.

Well, there are preachers in the pulpit and the babies in the cribs,
I'm longing for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs.
I'm gon' buy me a barrel of whiskey, I'll die before I turn senile.
Yes, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.

Well, you bet on a horse and it, it ran the wrong way,
I always said you'd be sorry and today could be the day.
I might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial.
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry a while.
