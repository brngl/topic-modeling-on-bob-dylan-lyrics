Everybody's building the big ships and boats,
Some are building monuments, others are jotting down notes,
Everybody's in despair, every girl and boy.
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody'll jump for joy.
Come all without, come all within,
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!

Now, I likes to do just like the rest, I like my sugar sweet,
But darting fumes and making haste, it ain't my cup of meat.
Everybody's just standing 'round 'neath the trees feeding pigeons on a limb,
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, them pigeons'll go to him.
Come all without, come all within,
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!

Now, lamp-gates and ..., I can recite 'em all,
Just tell me where it hurts and I'll tell you who to call.
Nobody can get any sleep, there's someone on everybody's toes,
But, when Quinn the Eskimo gets here, everybody's gonna doze.
Come all without, come all within,
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
Come all without, come all within,
You'll not see nothing like the mighty Quinn!
